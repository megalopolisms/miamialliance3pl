This ensures Amazon can scan and process your shipment without manually opening boxes — reducing check-in delays, avoiding non-compliance fees, and getting your inventory live faster."

                        <p class="faq-answer">Box Content Labeling is an Amazon FBA requirement where each shipping carton gets a printed label detailing its exact contents. <strong>Our $3.00/box service includes:</strong> generating the Box ID label from your Amazon shipment plan, listing every SKU/ASIN with exact quantities and condition (new, refurbished, etc.), printing the shipment ID and box sequence number, verifying item counts match your plan before sealing, and applying the label to each carton. This ensures Amazon's warehouse can scan and process your shipment without manually opening and counting boxes — reducing check-in delays, avoiding non-compliance fees, and getting your inventory live faster.</p>
