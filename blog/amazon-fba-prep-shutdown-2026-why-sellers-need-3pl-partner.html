For sellers moving fewer than 5,000 units per month, a 3PL is almost always more cost-effective because you avoid fixed overhead costs and benefit from the 3PL's bulk material pricing and trained staff."

                    <p class="article-lead">On January 1, 2026, Amazon quietly pulled the plug on one of the most relied-upon services in e-commerce logistics: FBA prep and labeling. No more Amazon-applied FNSKU labels. No more poly bagging at the fulfillment center. No more bundling on arrival. Every single unit that enters an Amazon warehouse must now arrive fully prepped, labeled, and compliant &mdash; or face rejection, penalty fees, and lost reimbursement rights. For the estimated 2 million active Amazon sellers worldwide, this is not a minor policy tweak. It is a fundamental shift in how products reach Amazon's shelves. And for sellers who have not yet secured a 3PL partner to handle prep, every day of delay is costing money.</p>

                    <h2 id="what-changed">What Changed on January 1, 2026</h2>

                    <p>Amazon's FBA prep service discontinuation is comprehensive. It is not limited to one service or one inbound channel. Every prep and labeling service that Amazon previously offered at its fulfillment centers has been eliminated. Here is exactly what changed:</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>FNSKU Labeling &mdash; Eliminated</h4>
                            <p>Amazon no longer applies FNSKU (Fulfillment Network Stock Keeping Unit) labels to your products. Every unit must arrive at the fulfillment center with the correct FNSKU barcode already affixed. This applies to all product types: standard, oversized, hazmat, and apparel. If a unit arrives without an FNSKU label, Amazon cannot track it in their system, which means it becomes untraceable and ineligible for any damage reimbursement.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Poly Bagging &mdash; Eliminated</h4>
                            <p>Products that require poly bag packaging &mdash; textiles, apparel, plush toys, items with loose parts, and anything that could be damaged by dust or moisture &mdash; must now arrive at the fulfillment center already bagged. Amazon previously offered poly bagging as an add-on prep service. That service no longer exists. Your products must arrive in compliant poly bags with suffocation warnings if the bag opening exceeds 5 inches.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Bubble Wrapping &mdash; Eliminated</h4>
                            <p>Fragile items that previously received bubble wrap protection at Amazon's fulfillment centers must now arrive pre-wrapped. This includes glass items, ceramics, electronics with screens, and any product that could break during warehouse handling. Amazon's internal damage rates for unwrapped fragile items can exceed 15% &mdash; and without prep service protection, that cost falls entirely on the seller.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Bundling &amp; Multi-Pack Assembly &mdash; Eliminated</h4>
                            <p>If you sell multi-packs, variety packs, or bundled products, Amazon no longer assembles them at the fulfillment center. Every bundle must arrive pre-assembled, shrink-wrapped or banded together, and labeled as a single unit with its own unique FNSKU. This is particularly impactful for sellers who relied on Amazon to combine individual units into sellable bundles.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="article-callout" style="border-left-color: #f59e0b;">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#x26A0;&#xFE0F;</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>All Inbound Channels Affected:</strong> The prep shutdown applies to inventory sent via FBA direct shipment, Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD), Amazon Global Logistics (AGL), Amazon SEND, and the Supply Chain Portal. There is no channel that still offers Amazon-side prep. Every route to Amazon's fulfillment network now requires seller-side or 3PL-side preparation.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2 id="why-amazon">Why Amazon Killed Prep Services</h2>

                    <p>Amazon's decision to eliminate FBA prep services was not arbitrary. It reflects a strategic shift in how Amazon allocates fulfillment center capacity and manages operational costs. Understanding the reasoning helps sellers anticipate what comes next.</p>

                    <div class="article-steps">
                        <div class="step-card">
                            <div class="step-number" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f59e0b, #d97706);">1</div>
                            <div class="step-content">
                                <h3>Capacity Optimization</h3>
                                <p>FBA prep consumed floor space, labor hours, and workflow complexity at fulfillment centers. By pushing prep to sellers and 3PLs, Amazon frees up capacity for higher-value activities: storage, picking, packing, and same-day shipping. With fulfillment center space at a premium &mdash; especially in Q4 &mdash; every square foot dedicated to prep is a square foot not available for revenue-generating operations.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                                <h3>Quality Control Shift</h3>
                                <p>Amazon is shifting quality responsibility to sellers. When Amazon prepped products, they assumed liability for prep-related damage and errors. By requiring seller-side prep, Amazon reduces its own defect rate and pushes accountability upstream. Sellers who send non-compliant inventory bear the full cost of returns, disposal, and customer complaints.</p>

                                <p>FBA prep required Amazon to maintain specialized prep stations, trained staff, and material inventories (labels, poly bags, bubble wrap) at every fulfillment center. Eliminating this service reduces Amazon's per-unit handling cost. The savings are not passed to sellers &mdash; instead, they are reinvested into faster delivery speeds and new fulfillment technology.</p>

                    <h2 id="consequences">The Consequences of Non-Compliance</h2>

                    <p>The stakes for sending unprepped inventory to Amazon post-January 2026 are severe. This is not a warning period &mdash; enforcement is immediate.</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">

                            <h4>Shipment Rejection</h4>
                            <p>Amazon can refuse to receive shipments that do not meet prep requirements at the dock. Rejected shipments are returned at the seller's expense, and the inbound shipping cost is not refunded. For sellers shipping full containers from overseas, a single rejection can cost $5,000 to $15,000 in wasted freight.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>Loss of Reimbursement Rights</h4>
                            <p>This is the most financially dangerous consequence. If your product arrives without proper prep and is subsequently damaged or lost in Amazon's fulfillment center, you are <strong>not eligible for reimbursement</strong>. Previously, Amazon's prep service included an implicit liability shield &mdash; if they prepped it and it got damaged, they covered the cost. That shield no longer exists. Every unit that arrives unprepped is at your risk.</p>

                            <h4>Coaching and Account Health Warnings</h4>
                            <p>Repeated non-compliance triggers coaching actions on your Seller Central account. Too many coaching actions degrade your Inventory Performance Index (IPI) score, which directly affects your FBA storage limits. A low IPI means less space at Amazon, which means fewer units available for Prime, which means lower sales velocity. The feedback loop is punishing.</p>

                            <p>Non-compliant inventory that Amazon cannot process may be flagged for disposal. Amazon charges $0.15 to $0.30 per unit for disposal, plus the cost of the inventory itself. For a 1,000-unit shipment of $20 products, that is $20,000 in product loss plus $150 to $300 in disposal fees. The product loss far exceeds the cost of proper prep.</p>

                            <strong>The Break-Even Point:</strong> For most sellers, a 3PL becomes cheaper than in-house prep at around <strong>500 units per month</strong>. Below 500 units, the fixed costs of equipment and space make DIY marginally cheaper on a per-unit basis &mdash; but the error rate and time cost still favor a 3PL. Above 500 units, the 3PL's bulk pricing, trained labor, and zero fixed overhead make it the clear winner. At 5,000+ units per month, the savings compound: a 3PL saves the average seller <strong>$3,000 to $8,000 per month</strong> compared to in-house prep.

                    <p>A 3PL that specializes in Amazon prep does not just slap labels on boxes. The service covers the entire inbound supply chain from factory to Amazon's dock.</p>

                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>FNSKU Labeling</h4>
                            <p>Your 3PL prints and applies the correct FNSKU barcode to every unit. This includes verifying the FNSKU against your Seller Central catalog, ensuring label placement meets Amazon's specifications (readable, not covering product barcodes), and applying suffocation warning labels to poly-bagged items. Label accuracy at a professional 3PL exceeds 99.5% &mdash; a rate that is nearly impossible to maintain with manual, in-house labeling.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Poly Bagging &amp; Protective Packaging</h4>
                            <p>Your 3PL selects the correct bag size, applies suffocation warnings, and seals each unit. For fragile items, bubble wrap is applied before bagging. For apparel, items are folded to Amazon's specifications, placed in clear poly bags, and labeled. The 3PL maintains an inventory of poly bags in all standard sizes (6x9 through 24x36) and switches between sizes based on your product mix &mdash; no need for you to order and store packaging materials.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>Bundling &amp; Kitting</h4>
                            <p>Multi-packs and bundles are assembled, shrink-wrapped or banded, and labeled as single units. The 3PL creates the FNSKU for the bundle, applies it, and verifies that the bundle contents match the listing. For sellers running variety packs or seasonal bundles, the 3PL can switch configurations without retooling &mdash; simply update the work order and the new bundle ships within 24 hours.</p>

                            <p>Before any prep work begins, your 3PL inspects incoming inventory for defects, damage, and quantity discrepancies. Catching defective units before they reach Amazon prevents negative reviews, A-to-Z claims, and return costs. A good 3PL will quarantine defective units, photograph the issues, and send you a report so you can file claims against your supplier while the evidence is fresh.</p>

                            <p>Your 3PL creates the FBA shipment plan in Seller Central, generates box content information, prints shipping labels, and coordinates carrier pickup. This eliminates the most time-consuming administrative task in the FBA inbound process. For sellers with multiple ASINs shipping to multiple fulfillment centers (Amazon's distributed inventory placement), the 3PL handles the split-shipment complexity automatically.</p>

Expired products are flagged before prep to prevent sending unsellable inventory to Amazon &mdash; a common mistake that results in stranded inventory fees and potential listing deactivation.</p>

When an FBA replenishment is needed, the 3PL preps and ships to Amazon. When an FBM order comes in, the 3PL picks, packs, and ships to the customer. You never split inventory between your garage and Amazon, which means no stockouts on one channel while the other has excess.</p>

The savings come from avoiding long-term storage fees on slow movers, eliminating oversized surcharges on FBM items, and maintaining higher inventory turnover by keeping the right products in the right channel. The 3PL makes this possible by managing both prep workflows from a single location.

                    <h2 id="choosing-3pl">How to Choose the Right 3PL for FBA Prep</h2>

                    <p>Not every 3PL is equipped to handle Amazon FBA prep. The requirements are specific, the compliance standards are exacting, and the consequences of errors are expensive. Here are the six criteria that matter most:</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>1. Amazon Prep Experience</h4>
                            <p>Ask how many Amazon sellers the 3PL currently serves and how long they have been doing FBA prep. A 3PL with 50+ active Amazon clients and 3+ years of FBA prep experience has seen every edge case: fragile items, multi-packs, hazmat products, and apparel. They know which products need poly bags vs. shrink wrap, which label placement works, and how to navigate Amazon's shipment split algorithm.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>2. Error Rate and QC Process</h4>
                            <p>Ask for the 3PL's prep error rate. Industry average is 2-5%. A good FBA prep 3PL runs below 1%. Ask what their quality control process looks like: do they have a dedicated QC station? Do they photograph units before and after prep? Do they catch defective supplier inventory before labeling? An error rate above 2% will cost you more in Amazon penalties than you save on prep fees.</p>

                            <p>How fast does the 3PL process inbound inventory? The best FBA prep 3PLs process received inventory within 24-48 hours and have it shipment-ready within 72 hours. Slow turnaround means your products sit in a 3PL warehouse instead of being available on Amazon &mdash; every day of delay is a day of lost sales. Ask about their turnaround SLA and what happens during peak season.</p>

                            <h4>4. Technology Integration</h4>
                            <p>Does the 3PL integrate with your Seller Central account? The best 3PLs use WMS (Warehouse Management System) software that syncs with Amazon's API, pulling shipment plans, generating labels, and updating inventory counts automatically. Manual 3PLs that rely on spreadsheets and email are slower, more error-prone, and harder to scale.</p>

                            <p>Where is the 3PL relative to Amazon's fulfillment centers? A 3PL in South Florida can reach Amazon FCs in Jacksonville, Tampa, and Atlanta within 1-2 days by ground. Proximity means lower inbound shipping costs and faster replenishment cycles. A 3PL on the West Coast serving East Coast FCs adds 4-5 days and significant freight cost to every shipment.</p>

Watch for hidden fees: receiving charges, minimum monthly fees, long-term storage surcharges, and peak season premiums. The best 3PLs offer transparent, per-unit pricing with no minimums and no long-term contracts &mdash; you pay only for what you use.</p>

                    <p>Miami is not just a logistics hub for international trade. It is increasingly a strategic location for Amazon sellers who need FBA prep, FBM fulfillment, and multi-channel distribution from a single facility.</p>

                            <h4>Southeast FC Coverage</h4>
                            <p>Miami-based 3PLs can reach Amazon fulfillment centers across the Southeast &mdash; Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Nashville &mdash; within 1-2 days by ground. These FCs serve the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the U.S. Faster replenishment means less time out of stock and better inventory performance on Amazon.</p>

                            <p>If your products originate from overseas &mdash; China, Latin America, Europe &mdash; Miami's port and airport infrastructure means your inventory can go directly from container to 3PL warehouse to Amazon FC without an intermediate stop. PortMiami and MIA handle the import, your 3PL handles the prep, and the prepped inventory ships to Amazon. One metro area, one supply chain.</p>

Your 3PL can communicate with your suppliers in Spanish or Portuguese, handle customs documentation, and coordinate inbound logistics in the same language as your supply chain.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Why did Amazon stop offering FBA prep services?</h3>
                            <p>Amazon discontinued FBA prep and labeling services effective January 1, 2026 as part of a broader strategy to shift operational complexity back to sellers and third-party logistics providers. By eliminating prep services, Amazon can focus its fulfillment center capacity on storage and shipping rather than product preparation. This applies to all inbound channels including <strong>AWD, Amazon Global Logistics, Amazon SEND, and the Supply Chain Portal</strong>.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>What happens if I send unprepped inventory to Amazon FBA after the shutdown?</h3>
                            <p>After January 1, 2026, shipments arriving at Amazon fulfillment centers without the required prep work will <strong>no longer be eligible for reimbursement</strong> if items are damaged or deemed untraceable. Amazon may refuse the shipment entirely, charge penalty fees, or dispose of non-compliant inventory. This means every label, poly bag, and bundle must be completed before your products reach Amazon's dock.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>How much does 3PL FBA prep cost compared to doing it in-house?</h3>
                            <p>A 3PL typically charges <strong>$0.50 to $2.50 per unit</strong> for FBA prep services including labeling, poly bagging, and inspection. In-house prep requires hiring warehouse staff ($15-20/hour), purchasing equipment (label printers, poly bag sealers, heat guns), renting workspace, and managing quality control. For sellers moving fewer than 5,000 units per month, a 3PL is almost always more cost-effective because you avoid fixed overhead costs and benefit from the 3PL's bulk material pricing and trained staff.</p>

                            <h3>Can a 3PL handle both FBA prep and FBM fulfillment?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. A full-service 3PL like Miami Alliance 3PL handles both <strong>FBA prep</strong> (labeling, poly bagging, bundling, and shipment creation for Amazon fulfillment centers) and <strong>FBM fulfillment</strong> (picking, packing, and shipping directly to customers). This hybrid approach gives sellers maximum flexibility: send fast-moving SKUs to FBA for Prime eligibility while fulfilling slower-moving or oversized items via FBM through your 3PL.</p>
