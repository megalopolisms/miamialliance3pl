                    <h2 id="scotus-ruling">What Just Happened: The Supreme Court Strikes Down IEEPA Tariffs</h2>

                    <p>On <strong>February 20, 2026</strong>, the United States Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling that fundamentally redraws the boundaries of presidential trade authority. In a decision that sent shockwaves through global markets, the Court held that the <strong>International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to impose tariffs</strong>.</p>

                    <p>The IEEPA, originally enacted in 1977, gives the president broad authority to regulate economic transactions during declared national emergencies. Since 2025, the Trump administration had relied heavily on IEEPA as the legal basis for sweeping tariffs on imports from China, Canada, Mexico, and dozens of other countries. The administration argued that trade deficits and fentanyl trafficking constituted national emergencies justifying tariff action under the statute.</p>

                    <p>The Supreme Court disagreed. In its ruling, the Court found that IEEPA's language authorizes the regulation, blocking, and freezing of financial transactions and property interests &mdash; but it does not extend to the imposition of customs duties on imported goods. The power to levy tariffs, the Court held, is a function of trade law, not emergency economic powers. Congress, not the president acting unilaterally under IEEPA, holds that authority.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#9878;</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>What This Means Legally:</strong> Every tariff that was imposed under IEEPA authority &mdash; including broad duties on Chinese, Canadian, and Mexican goods &mdash; was declared invalid by the Court. This does not affect tariffs imposed under other statutory authorities (Section 301, Section 232, or traditional trade remedy laws). But the IEEPA-based tariffs, which covered hundreds of billions of dollars in annual imports, are now legally void.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The ruling created immediate chaos at U.S. ports. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had been collecting IEEPA-based duties for over a year. The legal status of those previously collected duties is now uncertain, and importers are already filing claims for refunds. Meanwhile, CBP initially continued collecting IEEPA tariffs at certain ports in the days following the ruling &mdash; a situation that has drawn sharp criticism from trade attorneys and importers alike.</p>

                    <p>For importers, the ruling was both a victory and a warning. The IEEPA tariffs are gone, but the administration moved with extraordinary speed to replace them.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-122">The Immediate Response: Section 122 and the 15% Global Tariff</h2>

                    <p>Within two days of the Supreme Court ruling, the administration pivoted to an alternative legal authority: <strong>Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Section 122 authorizes the president to impose temporary import surcharges of up to 15% to address large and serious balance-of-payments deficits. Unlike IEEPA, Section 122 is explicitly a trade provision &mdash; it was designed for exactly this kind of action. However, it comes with significant limitations that IEEPA did not have.</p>

                    <p>Here is the timeline of what happened:</p>

                            <strong>Key Number:</strong> The 15% Section 122 tariff applies to approximately <strong>$1.2 trillion in annual imports</strong> &mdash; about 34% of all goods entering the U.S. This is the broadest single tariff action in decades, touching virtually every product category from electronics and auto parts to food and consumer goods.

                    <h3>Enforcement Confusion at the Border</h3>

                    <p>In the days immediately following the Supreme Court ruling, multiple reports emerged of CBP continuing to collect IEEPA-based tariffs at certain ports of entry &mdash; despite the Court having declared them invalid. This created a dual-collection problem where some importers were assessed both the now-void IEEPA duties and the new Section 122 duties.</p>

                    <p>If you imported goods between February 20 and February 24, review your entry documents carefully. You may have grounds to protest IEEPA-based assessments. Consult your customs broker or trade attorney immediately.</p>

                    <h3>China: A Layered Tariff Structure</h3>

                    <p>Chinese imports face the most complex tariff situation of any trading partner. Here is how the layers stack up:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fentanyl-related tariff (10%):</strong> Originally imposed at 20% as part of the administration's counter-narcotics strategy. Reduced to 10% following a November 2025 bilateral agreement in which China committed to expanded precursor chemical controls. This tariff is separate from the IEEPA-based duties that were struck down.</li>
                        <li><strong>Section 122 global tariff (15%):</strong> The new baseline tariff that applies to all countries, including China. Effective February 24, 2026.</li>
                        <li><strong>Section 301 tariffs (varies by product):</strong> These longstanding tariffs on specific Chinese goods &mdash; targeting technology, industrial components, and other strategic products &mdash; remain in effect. They were imposed under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (a different provision than Section 122) and were not affected by the Supreme Court ruling.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The result: depending on the product, importers of Chinese goods face effective duty rates <strong>ranging from 25% to over 50%</strong> when all layers are combined. Electronics, machinery, chemicals, and consumer products are particularly affected.</p>

                    <h3>Canada: USMCA Is Your Lifeline</h3>

                    <p>Canada has been subject to a <strong>35% tariff since August 2025</strong>. However, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) provides a critical exemption: goods that meet USMCA rules-of-origin requirements are exempt from the country-specific tariff.</p>

                    <p>This exemption has proven massively important. As of early 2026, <strong>89% of Canadian imports are entering the U.S. under USMCA claims</strong>, avoiding the 35% country-specific rate. However, these goods may still be subject to the new 15% Section 122 global tariff depending on product category and how CBP applies the new duty structure.</p>

                    <p>If you import from Canada and are not currently claiming USMCA origin, this is the single most impactful thing you can do to reduce your tariff exposure. Work with your supplier to obtain proper certificates of origin and verify that your products meet the agreement's rules-of-origin requirements.</p>

                    <h3>Mexico: Nearshoring Under Pressure</h3>

                    <p>Mexican imports carry a <strong>25% tariff imposed in 2025</strong>, with the same USMCA exemption structure as Canada. For businesses that have nearshored manufacturing to Mexico to reduce dependence on China, the USMCA exemption is what makes the strategy viable.</p>

                    <p>The new 15% Section 122 global tariff adds a further layer of cost, but USMCA-compliant goods still benefit significantly compared to non-USMCA imports. Mexico remains one of the most cost-effective sourcing alternatives for businesses moving away from China &mdash; provided the goods qualify under USMCA.</p>

                            <strong>Practical Tip:</strong> If you are importing from Canada or Mexico, audit your USMCA compliance immediately. The difference between USMCA-qualifying and non-qualifying goods can be 20-35 percentage points in duty rates. Many importers are leaving money on the table by not properly documenting origin.

                    <h2 id="supply-chain-impact">What This Means for Your Supply Chain</h2>

                    <p>The combined effect of the Supreme Court ruling, the new Section 122 tariff, and ongoing country-specific duties creates a set of operational and financial challenges that every importer needs to address. Here are the four most significant impacts:</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Cost Increases of 10-15%</h4>
                            <p>For most importers, the 15% Section 122 tariff translates directly to a 10-15% increase in landed cost. This applies even to countries that previously had no special tariff treatment. Importers of European, Southeast Asian, Indian, and South American goods are feeling tariff pressure for the first time in the current trade cycle.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>From Just-in-Time to Just-in-Case</h4>
                            <p>Tariff uncertainty is killing lean inventory strategies. When duty rates can change by executive order in 48 hours, businesses cannot afford to operate with minimal stock. The trend is toward carrying 60-90 days of inventory instead of 30 &mdash; a shift that requires significantly more warehouse space and working capital.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Supply Chain Diversification</h4>
                            <p>The China-plus-one strategy has accelerated into China-plus-many. Businesses are spreading sourcing across Vietnam, India, Mexico, Colombia, and other countries to reduce concentration risk. No single country tariff rate should be able to break your supply chain.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Warehouse Demand Surging</h4>
                            <p>The shift to larger safety stocks is driving record demand for warehouse space, especially in port-adjacent markets like Miami-Dade County. Importers who delayed securing warehouse capacity are now scrambling as vacancy rates in industrial corridors tighten further.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The 150-Day Uncertainty Window</h3>

                    <p>Perhaps the most challenging aspect of the current tariff environment is the built-in expiration of the Section 122 tariff. At 150 days, the 15% global duty sunsets around July 24, 2026 &mdash; unless Congress acts to extend or replace it.</p>

                    <p>This creates a planning nightmare. Do you stockpile inventory now at 15% duty, hoping rates go higher after Congress acts? Do you slow purchasing, betting the tariff expires and isn't replaced? The answer depends on your product, your margins, and your risk tolerance. But one thing is certain: businesses that have flexible warehousing arrangements will navigate this window far better than those locked into rigid commitments.</p>

                    <h2 id="miami-3pl-advantage">How a Miami 3PL Protects You During Tariff Uncertainty</h2>

                    <p>In a tariff environment this volatile, your logistics strategy is not just an operational decision &mdash; it is a financial one. Where you warehouse goods, how fast you can adjust inventory levels, and whether you can take advantage of trade-zone benefits all directly impact your bottom line. Here is how a Miami-based 3PL provides specific, tangible advantages during this period:</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Foreign Trade Zone Advantages</h4>
                            <p>Miami-Dade County is home to one of the nation's most active Foreign Trade Zones (FTZ). Goods stored in an FTZ are considered outside U.S. customs territory for duty purposes. This means you can defer duty payments until goods enter domestic commerce, reduce duties by using the FTZ's "inverted tariff" provisions, or re-export goods without ever paying U.S. duties. In a 15% global tariff environment, FTZ benefits can save thousands per shipment.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Flexible Storage for Stockpiling</h4>
                            <p>When tariff rates are about to change &mdash; or when you suspect a 150-day tariff may be extended &mdash; the smart move is often to accelerate imports and stockpile inventory at the current rate. A 3PL with flexible, no-minimum-commitment storage lets you scale from 10 pallets to 500 pallets without breaking a lease or signing a multi-year deal. When policy stabilizes, you scale back down.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Latin America Gateway: The Nearshoring Edge</h4>
                            <p>Miami is the undisputed gateway to Latin America. For businesses nearshoring production from China to Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, or other LATAM countries, Miami offers the shortest supply chain path. PortMiami handles direct routes to every major Latin American port. Goods arrive faster, clear customs sooner, and reach your customers in days instead of weeks.</p>

                            <p>Trade policy in 2026 demands agility. You cannot predict what tariff rates will look like in July, let alone December. A 3PL with no minimum order requirements and no long-term contracts gives you the freedom to adjust your supply chain in real time &mdash; increase imports when rates are favorable, pause when they are not, and never pay for space you are not using.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Miami's position is unique in the U.S. logistics landscape. It combines a top-5 container port, the number-one international freight airport, a major Foreign Trade Zone, direct Latin American trade routes, and a deep pool of bilingual customs brokers and freight forwarders &mdash; all within a 15-minute drive. No other U.S. metro offers this combination of trade infrastructure, and in the current tariff environment, that infrastructure translates directly to cost savings and supply chain resilience.</p>

                            <h3>What did the Supreme Court rule about IEEPA tariffs?</h3>
                            <p>On February 20, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) <strong>does not authorize the president to impose tariffs</strong>. All tariffs previously enacted under IEEPA authority were declared invalid. The Court held that IEEPA permits the regulation of financial transactions and property, but the power to levy customs duties belongs to Congress under trade law, not to the president under emergency powers.</p>

                            <h3>What is the Section 122 tariff and when does it take effect?</h3>
                            <p>Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the president to impose temporary duties of up to 15% for 150 days to address large trade deficits. On February 22, 2026, President Trump invoked Section 122 to impose a temporary duty on imports, effective February 24. The rate was initially set at 10% and raised to <strong>15% the same day</strong> &mdash; the statutory maximum. This tariff applies to approximately $1.2 trillion in annual imports and <strong>expires after 150 days (around July 24, 2026)</strong> unless Congress acts to extend or replace it.</p>

                            <h3>How do the 2026 tariffs affect imports from China?</h3>
                            <p>Chinese imports face a layered tariff structure in 2026. The fentanyl-related tariff was reduced from 20% to 10% following a November 2025 bilateral agreement. The new 15% global tariff under Section 122 also applies. Combined with pre-existing Section 301 tariffs on specific product categories, Chinese imports face <strong>effective duty rates ranging from 25% to over 50%</strong> depending on the product classification.</p>

                            <p>Yes. Goods that qualify under USMCA rules of origin are exempt from the country-specific tariffs on Canada (35%) and Mexico (25%). As of early 2026, approximately <strong>89% of Canadian imports are entering under USMCA exemptions</strong>. However, the new 15% Section 122 global tariff may still apply to some categories. Importers should verify USMCA compliance documentation carefully with their customs broker.</p>

                            <p>A 3PL warehouse in a strategic location like Miami provides several tariff-related advantages: access to <strong>Foreign Trade Zones</strong> where duties can be deferred or reduced, <strong>flexible storage capacity</strong> to stockpile inventory ahead of tariff increases, proximity to PortMiami for efficient customs clearance, and the ability to <strong>scale warehouse space up or down</strong> as trade policy shifts. Miami's position as the gateway to Latin America also supports nearshoring strategies that reduce dependence on high-tariff countries.</p>

                    <h2 id="scotus-ruling">Qu&eacute; Acaba de Suceder: La Corte Suprema Invalida los Aranceles IEEPA</h2>

                    <p>El <strong>20 de febrero de 2026</strong>, la Corte Suprema de los Estados Unidos emiti&oacute; un fallo hist&oacute;rico que redibuja fundamentalmente los l&iacute;mites de la autoridad comercial presidencial. En una decisi&oacute;n que envi&oacute; ondas de choque a trav&eacute;s de los mercados globales, la Corte determin&oacute; que la <strong>Ley de Poderes Econ&oacute;micos de Emergencia Internacional (IEEPA) no otorga al presidente el poder de imponer aranceles</strong>.</p>

                    <p>La IEEPA, promulgada originalmente en 1977, otorga al presidente amplia autoridad para regular transacciones econ&oacute;micas durante emergencias nacionales declaradas. Desde 2025, la administraci&oacute;n Trump hab&iacute;a dependido fuertemente de la IEEPA como base legal para aranceles amplios sobre importaciones de China, Canad&aacute;, M&eacute;xico y decenas de otros pa&iacute;ses. La administraci&oacute;n argument&oacute; que los d&eacute;ficits comerciales y el tr&aacute;fico de fentanilo constitu&iacute;an emergencias nacionales que justificaban la acci&oacute;n arancelaria bajo el estatuto.</p>

                    <p>La Corte Suprema discrep&oacute;. En su fallo, la Corte determin&oacute; que el lenguaje de la IEEPA autoriza la regulaci&oacute;n, bloqueo y congelaci&oacute;n de transacciones financieras e intereses de propiedad &mdash; pero no se extiende a la imposici&oacute;n de derechos aduaneros sobre productos importados. El poder de imponer aranceles, sostuvo la Corte, es una funci&oacute;n de la ley comercial, no de poderes econ&oacute;micos de emergencia. El Congreso, no el presidente actuando unilateralmente bajo la IEEPA, posee esa autoridad.</p>

                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>Qu&eacute; Significa Legalmente:</strong> Cada arancel que fue impuesto bajo la autoridad de IEEPA &mdash; incluyendo aranceles amplios sobre productos chinos, canadienses y mexicanos &mdash; fue declarado inv&aacute;lido por la Corte. Esto no afecta a los aranceles impuestos bajo otras autoridades estatutarias (Secci&oacute;n 301, Secci&oacute;n 232 o leyes tradicionales de remedio comercial). Pero los aranceles basados en IEEPA, que cubr&iacute;an cientos de miles de millones de d&oacute;lares en importaciones anuales, ahora son legalmente nulos.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>El fallo cre&oacute; un caos inmediato en los puertos de EE.UU. La Oficina de Aduanas y Protecci&oacute;n Fronteriza (CBP) hab&iacute;a estado cobrando aranceles basados en IEEPA por m&aacute;s de un a&ntilde;o. El estatus legal de esos aranceles previamente cobrados ahora es incierto, y los importadores ya est&aacute;n presentando reclamos de reembolso. Mientras tanto, CBP inicialmente continu&oacute; cobrando aranceles IEEPA en ciertos puertos en los d&iacute;as posteriores al fallo &mdash; una situaci&oacute;n que ha generado fuertes cr&iacute;ticas de abogados comerciales e importadores por igual.</p>

                    <p>Para los importadores, el fallo fue tanto una victoria como una advertencia. Los aranceles IEEPA se fueron, pero la administraci&oacute;n se movi&oacute; con velocidad extraordinaria para reemplazarlos.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-122">La Respuesta Inmediata: Secci&oacute;n 122 y el Arancel Global del 15%</h2>

                    <p>Dentro de dos d&iacute;as del fallo de la Corte Suprema, la administraci&oacute;n pivot&oacute; hacia una autoridad legal alternativa: la <strong>Secci&oacute;n 122 de la Ley de Comercio de 1974</strong>.</p>

                    <p>La Secci&oacute;n 122 autoriza al presidente a imponer sobrecargos temporales de importaci&oacute;n de hasta el 15% para abordar d&eacute;ficits grandes y graves en la balanza de pagos. A diferencia de la IEEPA, la Secci&oacute;n 122 es expl&iacute;citamente una disposici&oacute;n comercial &mdash; fue dise&ntilde;ada exactamente para este tipo de acci&oacute;n. Sin embargo, viene con limitaciones significativas que la IEEPA no ten&iacute;a.</p>

Esto cre&oacute; un problema de doble cobro donde a algunos importadores se les evaluaron tanto los aranceles IEEPA ahora nulos como los nuevos aranceles de la Secci&oacute;n 122.</p>

                    <p>Si importaste productos entre el 20 y el 24 de febrero, revisa tus documentos de entrada cuidadosamente. Podr&iacute;as tener fundamentos para protestar las evaluaciones basadas en IEEPA. Consulta a tu agente aduanal o abogado comercial inmediatamente.</p>

                    <h3>China: Una Estructura Arancelaria por Capas</h3>

                    <p>Las importaciones chinas enfrentan la situaci&oacute;n arancelaria m&aacute;s compleja de cualquier socio comercial. As&iacute; se acumulan las capas:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Arancel relacionado con fentanilo (10%):</strong> Originalmente impuesto al 20% como parte de la estrategia antinarc&oacute;ticos de la administraci&oacute;n. Reducido al 10% tras un acuerdo bilateral en noviembre de 2025 en el que China se comprometi&oacute; a expandir los controles de qu&iacute;micos precursores. Este arancel es independiente de los aranceles basados en IEEPA que fueron invalidados.</li>
                        <li><strong>Arancel global de la Secci&oacute;n 122 (15%):</strong> El nuevo arancel base que se aplica a todos los pa&iacute;ses, incluyendo China. Vigente desde el 24 de febrero de 2026.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aranceles de la Secci&oacute;n 301 (var&iacute;a por producto):</strong> Estos aranceles de larga data sobre productos chinos espec&iacute;ficos &mdash; dirigidos a tecnolog&iacute;a, componentes industriales y otros productos estrat&eacute;gicos &mdash; permanecen vigentes. Fueron impuestos bajo la Secci&oacute;n 301 de la Ley de Comercio de 1974 (una disposici&oacute;n diferente a la Secci&oacute;n 122) y no fueron afectados por el fallo de la Corte Suprema.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>El resultado: dependiendo del producto, los importadores de productos chinos enfrentan tasas arancelarias efectivas <strong>que van del 25% a m&aacute;s del 50%</strong> cuando se combinan todas las capas. Electr&oacute;nica, maquinaria, qu&iacute;micos y productos de consumo se ven particularmente afectados.</p>

                    <h3>Canad&aacute;: El USMCA Es Tu L&iacute;nea de Vida</h3>

                    <p>Canad&aacute; ha estado sujeta a un <strong>arancel del 35% desde agosto de 2025</strong>. Sin embargo, el Tratado entre M&eacute;xico, Estados Unidos y Canad&aacute; (T-MEC/USMCA) proporciona una exenci&oacute;n cr&iacute;tica: los productos que cumplen con los requisitos de reglas de origen del USMCA est&aacute;n exentos del arancel espec&iacute;fico por pa&iacute;s.</p>

                    <p>Esta exenci&oacute;n ha demostrado ser enormemente importante. A principios de 2026, <strong>el 89% de las importaciones canadienses ingresan a EE.UU. bajo reclamos USMCA</strong>, evitando la tasa espec&iacute;fica por pa&iacute;s del 35%. Sin embargo, estos productos a&uacute;n pueden estar sujetos al nuevo arancel global del 15% de la Secci&oacute;n 122 dependiendo de la categor&iacute;a de producto y c&oacute;mo CBP aplique la nueva estructura arancelaria.</p>

                    <p>Si importas desde Canad&aacute; y actualmente no est&aacute;s reclamando origen USMCA, esta es la acci&oacute;n individual m&aacute;s impactante que puedes tomar para reducir tu exposici&oacute;n arancelaria. Trabaja con tu proveedor para obtener los certificados de origen adecuados y verifica que tus productos cumplan con los requisitos de reglas de origen del acuerdo.</p>

                    <h3>M&eacute;xico: Nearshoring Bajo Presi&oacute;n</h3>

                    <p>Las importaciones mexicanas tienen un <strong>arancel del 25% impuesto en 2025</strong>, con la misma estructura de exenci&oacute;n USMCA que Canad&aacute;. Para las empresas que han hecho nearshoring de manufactura a M&eacute;xico para reducir la dependencia de China, la exenci&oacute;n USMCA es lo que hace viable la estrategia.</p>

                    <p>El nuevo arancel global del 15% de la Secci&oacute;n 122 a&ntilde;ade una capa adicional de costo, pero los productos compatibles con USMCA a&uacute;n se benefician significativamente en comparaci&oacute;n con las importaciones no USMCA. M&eacute;xico sigue siendo una de las alternativas de abastecimiento m&aacute;s costo-efectivas para empresas que se alejan de China &mdash; siempre que los productos califiquen bajo el USMCA.</p>

                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>Consejo Pr&aacute;ctico:</strong> Si est&aacute;s importando desde Canad&aacute; o M&eacute;xico, audita tu cumplimiento con el USMCA inmediatamente. La diferencia entre productos que califican bajo USMCA y los que no puede ser de 20-35 puntos porcentuales en tasas arancelarias. Muchos importadores est&aacute;n dejando dinero sobre la mesa al no documentar adecuadamente el origen.

                    <p>El efecto combinado del fallo de la Corte Suprema, el nuevo arancel de la Secci&oacute;n 122 y los aranceles espec&iacute;ficos por pa&iacute;s vigentes crea un conjunto de desaf&iacute;os operativos y financieros que cada importador necesita abordar. Estos son los cuatro impactos m&aacute;s significativos:</p>

                            <p>Para la mayor&iacute;a de los importadores, el arancel del 15% de la Secci&oacute;n 122 se traduce directamente en un aumento del 10-15% en el costo nacionalizado. Esto aplica incluso a pa&iacute;ses que previamente no ten&iacute;an tratamiento arancelario especial. Los importadores de productos europeos, del sudeste asi&aacute;tico, indios y sudamericanos est&aacute;n sintiendo presi&oacute;n arancelaria por primera vez en el ciclo comercial actual.</p>

                            <p>La incertidumbre arancelaria est&aacute; matando las estrategias de inventario lean. Cuando las tasas arancelarias pueden cambiar por orden ejecutiva en 48 horas, las empresas no pueden permitirse operar con stock m&iacute;nimo. La tendencia es hacia mantener 60-90 d&iacute;as de inventario en lugar de 30 &mdash; un cambio que requiere significativamente m&aacute;s espacio de almac&eacute;n y capital de trabajo.</p>

                    <h3>La Ventana de Incertidumbre de 150 D&iacute;as</h3>

                    <p>Quiz&aacute;s el aspecto m&aacute;s desafiante del entorno arancelario actual es la expiraci&oacute;n incorporada del arancel de la Secci&oacute;n 122. A los 150 d&iacute;as, el arancel global del 15% expira alrededor del 24 de julio de 2026 &mdash; a menos que el Congreso act&uacute;e para extenderlo o reemplazarlo.</p>

                    <p>Esto crea una pesadilla de planificaci&oacute;n. &iquest;Acumulas inventario ahora al 15% de arancel, esperando que las tasas suban despu&eacute;s de que el Congreso act&uacute;e? &iquest;Desaceleras las compras, apostando a que el arancel expire y no sea reemplazado? La respuesta depende de tu producto, tus m&aacute;rgenes y tu tolerancia al riesgo. Pero una cosa es cierta: las empresas que tienen acuerdos de almacenamiento flexibles navegar&aacute;n esta ventana mucho mejor que aquellas atadas a compromisos r&iacute;gidos.</p>

                    <p>En un entorno arancelario tan vol&aacute;til, tu estrategia log&iacute;stica no es solo una decisi&oacute;n operativa &mdash; es una decisi&oacute;n financiera. D&oacute;nde almacenas productos, qu&eacute; tan r&aacute;pido puedes ajustar niveles de inventario y si puedes aprovechar los beneficios de las zonas de comercio, todo impacta directamente en tu resultado final. As&iacute; es como un 3PL con sede en Miami proporciona ventajas espec&iacute;ficas y tangibles durante este per&iacute;odo:</p>

                            <h4>Ventajas de las Zonas de Comercio Exterior</h4>
                            <p>El Condado de Miami-Dade alberga una de las Zonas de Comercio Exterior (FTZ) m&aacute;s activas del pa&iacute;s. Los productos almacenados en una FTZ se consideran fuera del territorio aduanero de EE.UU. para efectos de aranceles. Esto significa que puedes diferir pagos de aranceles hasta que los productos ingresen al comercio dom&eacute;stico, reducir aranceles usando las disposiciones de "arancel invertido" de la FTZ, o reexportar productos sin pagar aranceles de EE.UU. En un entorno de arancel global del 15%, los beneficios de FTZ pueden ahorrar miles por env&iacute;o.</p>

Un 3PL con almacenamiento flexible, sin compromiso m&iacute;nimo, te permite escalar de 10 pallets a 500 pallets sin romper un arrendamiento o firmar un acuerdo multianual. Cuando la pol&iacute;tica se estabilice, reduces la escala.</p>

                            <p>Miami es la puerta de entrada indiscutible a Am&eacute;rica Latina. Para empresas que hacen nearshoring de producci&oacute;n desde China a M&eacute;xico, Colombia, Brasil u otros pa&iacute;ses LATAM, Miami ofrece la ruta de cadena de suministro m&aacute;s corta. PortMiami maneja rutas directas a todos los principales puertos latinoamericanos. Los productos llegan m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido, pasan aduanas antes y llegan a tus clientes en d&iacute;as en lugar de semanas.</p>

Un 3PL sin requisitos m&iacute;nimos de pedido y sin contratos a largo plazo te da la libertad de ajustar tu cadena de suministro en tiempo real &mdash; aumentar importaciones cuando las tasas son favorables, pausar cuando no lo son, y nunca pagar por espacio que no est&aacute;s usando.</p>

                    <p>La posici&oacute;n de Miami es &uacute;nica en el panorama log&iacute;stico de EE.UU.

Ninguna otra &aacute;rea metropolitana de EE.UU. ofrece esta combinaci&oacute;n de infraestructura comercial, y en el entorno arancelario actual, esa infraestructura se traduce directamente en ahorros de costos y resiliencia de la cadena de suministro.</p>

                            <h3>&iquest;Qu&eacute; dictamin&oacute; la Corte Suprema sobre los aranceles IEEPA?</h3>
                            <p>El 20 de febrero de 2026, la Corte Suprema de EE.UU. dictamin&oacute; que la Ley de Poderes Econ&oacute;micos de Emergencia Internacional (IEEPA) <strong>no autoriza al presidente a imponer aranceles</strong>. Todos los aranceles previamente promulgados bajo la autoridad de IEEPA fueron declarados inv&aacute;lidos. La Corte sostuvo que la IEEPA permite la regulaci&oacute;n de transacciones financieras y propiedad, pero el poder de imponer aranceles aduaneros pertenece al Congreso bajo la ley comercial, no al presidente bajo poderes de emergencia.</p>

                            <h3>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es el arancel de la Secci&oacute;n 122 y cu&aacute;ndo entra en vigor?</h3>
                            <p>La Secci&oacute;n 122 de la Ley de Comercio de 1974 autoriza al presidente a imponer aranceles temporales de hasta el 15% por 150 d&iacute;as para abordar grandes d&eacute;ficits comerciales. El 22 de febrero de 2026, el Presidente Trump invoc&oacute; la Secci&oacute;n 122 para imponer un arancel temporal sobre las importaciones, vigente desde el 24 de febrero. La tasa se estableci&oacute; inicialmente en 10% y se elev&oacute; al <strong>15% el mismo d&iacute;a</strong> &mdash; el m&aacute;ximo estatutario. Este arancel se aplica a aproximadamente $1.2 billones en importaciones anuales y <strong>expira despu&eacute;s de 150 d&iacute;as (alrededor del 24 de julio de 2026)</strong> a menos que el Congreso act&uacute;e para extenderlo o reemplazarlo.</p>

                            <h3>&iquest;C&oacute;mo afectan los aranceles de 2026 a las importaciones desde China?</h3>
                            <p>Las importaciones chinas enfrentan una estructura arancelaria por capas en 2026. El arancel relacionado con fentanilo se redujo del 20% al 10% tras un acuerdo bilateral en noviembre de 2025. El nuevo arancel global del 15% bajo la Secci&oacute;n 122 tambi&eacute;n aplica. Combinado con los aranceles preexistentes de la Secci&oacute;n 301 sobre categor&iacute;as espec&iacute;ficas de producto, las importaciones chinas enfrentan <strong>tasas arancelarias efectivas que van del 25% a m&aacute;s del 50%</strong> dependiendo de la clasificaci&oacute;n del producto.</p>

                            <h3>&iquest;Est&aacute;n los productos compatibles con USMCA de Canad&aacute; y M&eacute;xico exentos de aranceles?</h3>
                            <p>S&iacute;. Los productos que califican bajo las reglas de origen del USMCA est&aacute;n exentos de los aranceles espec&iacute;ficos por pa&iacute;s sobre Canad&aacute; (35%) y M&eacute;xico (25%). A principios de 2026, aproximadamente <strong>el 89% de las importaciones canadienses ingresan bajo exenciones USMCA</strong>. Sin embargo, el nuevo arancel global del 15% de la Secci&oacute;n 122 a&uacute;n puede aplicarse a algunas categor&iacute;as. Los importadores deben verificar cuidadosamente la documentaci&oacute;n de cumplimiento USMCA con su agente aduanal.</p>

                            <h3>&iquest;C&oacute;mo puede un 3PL ayudar a los importadores a manejar la incertidumbre arancelaria?</h3>
                            <p>Un almac&eacute;n 3PL en una ubicaci&oacute;n estrat&eacute;gica como Miami proporciona varias ventajas relacionadas con aranceles: acceso a <strong>Zonas de Comercio Exterior</strong> donde los aranceles pueden diferirse o reducirse, <strong>capacidad de almacenamiento flexible</strong> para acumular inventario antes de aumentos arancelarios, proximidad a PortMiami para despacho aduanero eficiente, y la capacidad de <strong>escalar espacio de almac&eacute;n hacia arriba o abajo</strong> a medida que la pol&iacute;tica comercial cambia. La posici&oacute;n de Miami como puerta de entrada a Am&eacute;rica Latina tambi&eacute;n apoya estrategias de nearshoring que reducen la dependencia de pa&iacute;ses con altos aranceles.</p>
