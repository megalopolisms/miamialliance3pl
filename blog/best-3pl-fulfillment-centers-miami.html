A good 3PL will manage most of this transition for you. Miami Alliance 3PL offers a dedicated onboarding specialist to make the switch seamless."

                    <p>Miami is one of the most important logistics hubs in the Americas. Between PortMiami, Miami International Airport (the #1 international freight airport in the U.S.), and the Medley/Doral industrial corridor, the region is home to a dense concentration of 3PL providers. That's good news for businesses looking for fulfillment partners &mdash; but it also means you have a lot of options to sort through.</p>

                    <p>This guide is built from real industry research, firsthand experience operating in the Miami 3PL market, and conversations with dozens of e-commerce brands who have navigated the selection process. Whether you're a DTC startup shipping 50 orders a month or an established brand processing thousands, you'll find actionable guidance here.</p>

                    <h2 id="what-to-look-for">What to Look For in a Miami 3PL</h2>

                    <p>Before diving into specific companies, let's establish the evaluation criteria that matter most. Not every 3PL is right for every business, and knowing what to prioritize will save you months of frustration down the line.</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Location & Proximity to Shipping Hubs</h4>
                            <p>A 3PL located near major carrier hubs, the airport, and the port means faster transit times and lower shipping costs. The Medley/Doral area in Miami-Dade is the epicenter &mdash; within 15 minutes of MIA and 30 minutes of PortMiami. Ground shipping from here reaches 80% of the continental U.S. in 2-3 days.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Services Offered</h4>
                            <p>Beyond basic pick-pack-ship, evaluate whether the 3PL offers FBA prep, kitting, custom packaging, returns processing, and specialty handling. The broader the service menu, the less you'll need to coordinate with multiple vendors as your business grows.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Pricing Transparency</h4>
                            <p>The best 3PLs publish clear rate cards or offer instant online quotes. Watch for hidden fees: setup charges, monthly account management fees, long-term contracts, and surprise surcharges during peak season. If a 3PL won't give you a straightforward rate card, that's a red flag.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Minimum Order Requirements</h4>
                            <p>Many established 3PLs require 300-500+ orders per month. If you're a growing brand, this can be a dealbreaker. Some Miami 3PLs have no minimums at all &mdash; meaning you get professional fulfillment from day one without meeting an arbitrary volume threshold.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Technology & Integrations</h4>
                            <p>Your 3PL's tech stack matters. Look for native integrations with Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, and major marketplaces. A real-time customer portal where you can track inventory levels, order status, and shipment tracking is essential &mdash; not optional.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Specialization</h4>
                            <p>Some 3PLs specialize in e-commerce DTC fulfillment, others in B2B distribution, subscription boxes, or regulated products like supplements and cosmetics. Choosing a 3PL that understands your product category means fewer mistakes and faster onboarding.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Scalability</h4>
                            <p>Your 3PL should be able to handle your current volume AND your peak-season spikes without breaking a sweat. Ask about their capacity during Q4, Black Friday, and promotional launches. If they can't scale with you, you'll outgrow them &mdash; and switching 3PLs mid-growth is painful.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Customer Service & Communication</h4>
                            <p>This is the factor most brands underestimate. When something goes wrong (and in logistics, something always goes wrong), do you get a dedicated account manager on the phone &mdash; or do you get routed to a support ticket queue? Responsiveness separates good 3PLs from great ones.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Below is our profile of seven 3PL providers operating in the greater Miami area. We've included factual details about each company's location, services, and target market to help you narrow down your shortlist.</p>

                    <h3 id="miami-alliance">1. Miami Alliance 3PL</h3>

                        <div class="callout-icon">📍</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>Location:</strong> 8780 NW 100th ST, Medley, FL 33178 &mdash; Heart of the Medley/Doral industrial corridor, 12 minutes from MIA.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Miami Alliance 3PL</strong> is a full-service third-party logistics provider built specifically for e-commerce brands, DTC companies, and growing businesses that need professional fulfillment without the overhead of large-scale contracts. What sets Miami Alliance apart from the competition is a combination of zero minimum order requirements, transparent pricing, and a hands-on approach to customer service that larger national providers simply cannot match.</p>

                    <p><strong>Services:</strong> Warehousing, pick-pack-ship, Amazon FBA prep (FNSKU labeling, poly bagging, palletizing), security black wrapping for high-value products, kitting and assembly, custom branded packaging, returns processing, and freight coordination. They also offer inventory management through a real-time customer portal with live stock counts, order tracking, and shipment history.</p>

                    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Miami Alliance integrates natively with Shopify, Amazon Seller Central, WooCommerce, and other major platforms. Orders flow automatically into the warehouse management system &mdash; no manual data entry, no CSV uploads. Their customer portal provides real-time visibility into inventory levels, order status, and shipping performance metrics.</p>

                    <p><strong>Minimum orders:</strong> None. Miami Alliance works with brands shipping as few as 10 orders per month and scales up to 10,000+ orders per month. This is one of the most important differentiators in the Miami market, where most competitors require 200-500+ orders monthly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Transparent rate cards available on request, with an instant online quote tool. No setup fees, no long-term contracts, no hidden account management charges. You pay for what you use: storage, pick-and-pack, and shipping handling.</p>

                    <p><strong>Specialization:</strong> E-commerce fulfillment, high-value products, nicotine pouches and regulated consumables, small-to-mid DTC brands, Amazon FBA prep, and Latin American import/export logistics.</p>

                    <p><strong>Key differentiators:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No minimum order requirements &mdash; the only Miami 3PL that genuinely welcomes startups and micro-brands</li>
                        <li>Same-day fulfillment for all orders placed before 2:00 PM EST</li>
                        <li>Dedicated account manager for every client, regardless of volume</li>
                        <li>Transparent, all-in pricing with no hidden fees</li>
                        <li>Strategic location in Medley for LATAM gateway and rapid Southeast U.S. delivery</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Growing DTC brands, startups launching their first product, Shopify and Amazon sellers, businesses needing flexible 3PL that scales with them, and companies importing from Latin America or the Caribbean.</p>

                    <h3 id="shipbob">2. ShipBob Miami</h3>

                    <p><strong>ShipBob</strong> is a national 3PL with a network of fulfillment centers across the United States, including a Miami-area location. Founded in 2014, ShipBob has grown into one of the most recognized names in e-commerce fulfillment, backed by over $330 million in venture funding.</p>

                    <p><strong>Services:</strong> Pick-pack-ship, distributed inventory across multiple warehouses, freight management, B2B fulfillment, and returns processing. ShipBob's multi-location model lets you split inventory across several warehouses to reduce transit times to different regions of the country.</p>

                    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> ShipBob's proprietary software platform is one of the strongest in the industry. Native integrations with Shopify, Amazon, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and dozens of other platforms. Real-time analytics dashboard with shipping performance, inventory forecasting, and cost breakdowns.</p>

                    <p><strong>Minimum orders:</strong> ShipBob generally works best for brands shipping 200+ orders per month. While they don't publish a strict hard minimum, their pricing structure and onboarding process is optimized for mid-to-high volume brands. Brands with very low volume may find the per-unit economics less favorable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> ShipBob uses a quote-based pricing model. Costs include a standard implementation fee, monthly storage fees, pick-and-pack fees, and shipping. Pricing is competitive at scale but can feel expensive for brands under 300 orders per month.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Mid-to-large volume Shopify brands that want multi-warehouse distribution, data-driven inventory placement, and a well-known 3PL partner. Ideal if you need to split inventory between East Coast and West Coast fulfillment centers.</p>

                    <h3 id="global-warehouse">3. Global Warehouse Solutions</h3>

                    <p><strong>Global Warehouse Solutions</strong> is a full-service 3PL based in the Doral area of Miami-Dade County. They've been operating in South Florida for over a decade and primarily serve established brands with consistent, predictable volume.</p>

                    <p><strong>Services:</strong> Warehousing, pick-pack-ship, cross-docking, LTL and FTL freight management, custom packaging, and container destuffing. They also offer transloading services for importers bringing goods through PortMiami.</p>

                    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> WMS with basic e-commerce integrations. Their technology stack is functional but not as feature-rich as some newer, tech-first competitors. Inventory reporting is available but may not offer the same real-time granularity as more modern platforms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Minimum orders:</strong> Global Warehouse generally requires a minimum monthly commitment, typically in the range of 300-500 orders or a storage minimum. Their sweet spot is brands with steady, established volume rather than early-stage companies.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Custom quotes based on volume. Their pricing is competitive for larger accounts with predictable monthly throughput. Expect setup fees and possible long-term contract terms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Established brands with consistent order volume, companies that need cross-docking or transloading from PortMiami, and businesses with complex B2B distribution requirements alongside DTC fulfillment.</p>

                    <h3 id="priority-fulfillment">4. Priority Fulfillment (Medley)</h3>

                    <p><strong>Priority Fulfillment</strong> is a local 3PL operating out of the same Medley industrial zone that houses many of Miami's logistics companies. They offer general-purpose fulfillment services with a focus on the South Florida regional market.</p>

                    <p><strong>Services:</strong> Warehousing, pick-pack-ship, light assembly, and basic returns handling. Their service offering is more streamlined compared to full-service providers, but they cover the fundamentals well for straightforward fulfillment needs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Basic WMS with manual and semi-automated order processing. Integration options are more limited &mdash; typically requiring CSV-based order imports rather than real-time API connections for smaller platforms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Minimum orders:</strong> Lower minimums than many national providers, making them accessible to smaller businesses. Their minimum threshold is generally more approachable than ShipBob or Global Warehouse, though not as low as Miami Alliance's zero-minimum policy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Competitive local rates. Without the overhead of a national network, Priority Fulfillment can offer straightforward pricing for businesses that only need a single Miami-based fulfillment point.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Regional businesses serving the Southeast U.S. and Caribbean markets, brands with straightforward fulfillment needs (no complex kitting or FBA prep), and companies that want a no-frills local warehouse partner.</p>

                    <h3 id="nxtpoint">5. NXTPoint Logistics</h3>

                    <p><strong>NXTPoint Logistics</strong> is a national supply chain management company with a presence in the Miami area as part of their broader multi-location network. They position themselves as a full supply-chain solution, managing everything from inbound freight to final-mile delivery.</p>

                    <p><strong>Services:</strong> End-to-end supply chain management, multi-location fulfillment, freight brokerage, reverse logistics, value-added services (labeling, kitting, quality inspection), and dedicated contract logistics. NXTPoint is more of a supply-chain orchestrator than a simple pick-pack-ship warehouse.</p>

                    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Enterprise-grade WMS and TMS (Transportation Management System). Strong integration capabilities for larger clients with complex ERP systems. Their tech is built for operational scale rather than small-brand self-service.</p>

                    <p><strong>Minimum orders:</strong> NXTPoint typically works with mid-to-large clients. Their service model and pricing structure is designed for brands shipping 500+ orders per month or companies with significant B2B distribution requirements.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Custom enterprise pricing. Expect a consultative sales process with tailored proposals based on your specific supply chain needs. Not ideal for quick online quotes or transparent rate cards.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Companies that need multi-location distribution across the U.S., brands with complex supply chains involving both B2B and DTC channels, and businesses looking for a single partner to manage their entire logistics operation from port to doorstep.</p>

                    <h3 id="aps-fulfillment">6. APS Fulfillment</h3>

                    <p><strong>APS Fulfillment</strong> is a South Florida-based 3PL that has carved out a niche in subscription box fulfillment and recurring-order logistics. Located in the greater Miami area, they've built their operations around the unique demands of brands that ship on a monthly or recurring schedule.</p>

                    <p><strong>Services:</strong> Subscription box assembly and fulfillment, e-commerce pick-pack-ship, product kitting, promotional mailer assembly, and print-on-demand fulfillment coordination. Their specialty is complex kitting projects where each box contains a curated mix of products that changes monthly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> WMS with integrations for major e-commerce platforms. Their system is particularly strong at managing subscription-specific workflows: batch processing, recurring order automation, and variable kit configurations.</p>

                    <p><strong>Minimum orders:</strong> APS generally works with brands that have a baseline subscription count. While they don't always publish firm minimums, their operational model is optimized for recurring fulfillment rather than sporadic, low-volume shipping.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Custom quotes with a focus on per-kit or per-box pricing. Subscription fulfillment pricing can be different from standard e-commerce fulfillment because of the kitting labor involved. Expect a consultative pricing process.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Subscription box brands, companies with recurring monthly shipments, brands that need complex kitting with variable product mixes, and businesses in the beauty, food, or lifestyle subscription space.</p>

                    <h3 id="stockmatic">7. Stockmatic</h3>

                    <p><strong>Stockmatic</strong> takes a technology-first approach to third-party logistics, building their operations around software automation and data-driven fulfillment. They serve the Miami e-commerce market with a focus on brands that value real-time data and API-first integration.</p>

                    <p><strong>Services:</strong> E-commerce fulfillment, inventory management with advanced analytics, multi-channel order routing, automated shipping label generation, and performance reporting. Their service model leans heavily on technology to reduce manual touchpoints and speed up processing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Stockmatic's strongest selling point. Their platform offers deep analytics, real-time inventory tracking, automated reorder alerts, and robust API access for custom integrations. If your tech team wants to build custom workflows on top of your 3PL's system, Stockmatic's API is worth evaluating.</p>

                    <p><strong>Minimum orders:</strong> Varies. Their tech-forward model can accommodate different volume levels, though the platform's value proposition becomes more compelling at moderate-to-high order volumes where data analytics and automation deliver clear ROI.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Technology-inclusive pricing that bundles software access with fulfillment services. This can be cost-effective for brands that would otherwise pay separately for a WMS or inventory management platform.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Tech-savvy e-commerce brands, companies with in-house development teams that want API access, data-driven businesses that prioritize analytics and reporting, and brands selling across many channels simultaneously.</p>

                    <p>Every business has different logistics needs. Instead of trying to find the "objectively best" 3PL, focus on finding the one that fits your specific situation. Here's a decision framework based on common scenarios:</p>

                                <p><strong>Go with Miami Alliance 3PL.</strong> Most 3PLs will either reject you outright or charge minimums that destroy your unit economics at low volume. Miami Alliance has no minimums, no setup fees, and no long-term contracts. You get the same professional fulfillment infrastructure that 10,000-order brands use, but you only pay for what you ship. This is the only Miami 3PL that genuinely makes economic sense at startup volumes.</p>

                                <p><strong>Consider ShipBob or NXTPoint Logistics.</strong> If your customer base is spread across the entire U.S. and you want to split inventory between East Coast, West Coast, and Central warehouses to reduce transit times, you need a 3PL with a national network. ShipBob's distributed fulfillment model is purpose-built for this. NXTPoint is the better option if you also have complex B2B distribution needs alongside DTC.</p>

Variable kit configurations, batch processing, coordinated ship dates, and monthly product rotations require a 3PL that has built their workflow around these recurring patterns.

                    <h2 id="questions-to-ask">Questions to Ask Before Signing with a Miami 3PL</h2>

                    <p>Before you commit to any 3PL provider, get clear answers to these ten questions. These are the questions that experienced e-commerce operators have learned (often the hard way) to ask upfront:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>What are your all-in costs per order at my current volume?</strong> Get a complete cost breakdown &mdash; storage, pick-and-pack, shipping handling, and any additional fees. Ask them to model pricing at your current volume AND at 2x your volume so you can see how costs scale.</li>

                        <li><strong>Do you have minimum order requirements or monthly minimums?</strong> Some 3PLs charge minimum monthly fees even if you don't hit a certain order count. Know exactly what you're committing to in slow months.</li>

                        <li><strong>What is your order accuracy rate?</strong> Industry standard is 99%+. Ask for documented accuracy rates, not just claims. Any provider below 99% should be approached with caution. The best operators maintain 99.5% or higher.</li>

                        <li><strong>What is your same-day shipping cutoff time?</strong> Most Miami 3PLs use a 2:00 PM EST cutoff for same-day processing. Confirm this and ask what percentage of orders actually ship same-day in practice.</li>

                        <li><strong>Which e-commerce platforms do you integrate with natively?</strong> "We can integrate with anything" is not the same as a tested, production-ready Shopify or Amazon integration. Ask to see the integration in action or talk to a current client on the same platform.</li>

                        <li><strong>What does your customer portal look like?</strong> Ask for a demo of the portal you'll actually use day-to-day. Can you see real-time inventory counts? Track individual shipments? Pull reports? Export data? A clunky or outdated portal will cause daily frustration.</li>

                        <li><strong>How do you handle returns?</strong> Returns processing is where many 3PLs cut corners. Ask about their inspection process, restocking criteria, turnaround time for refunds, and how returned inventory is tracked in the system.</li>

                        <li><strong>What happens during peak season (Q4, Black Friday)?</strong> Ask about their capacity, staffing plans, and whether they impose peak-season surcharges. Some 3PLs throttle onboarding or increase rates during November-December.</li>

                        <li><strong>Can I visit the warehouse?</strong> Any legitimate 3PL should welcome a facility tour. Look at organization, cleanliness, how staff handle products, security measures, and overall professionalism. If they won't let you visit, walk away.</li>

                        <li><strong>What are the contract terms and exit process?</strong> Understand the contract length, notice period for termination, and the process for retrieving your inventory if you decide to leave. The best 3PLs offer month-to-month agreements with 30-day notice periods &mdash; because they earn your business every month rather than locking you in.</li>
                    </ol>

                            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't just ask the 3PL these questions &mdash; ask their current clients. Any reputable 3PL should be willing to connect you with two or three reference accounts. Talk to real brands about their experience with accuracy, communication, billing, and problem resolution.

                            <h3>Which 3PL in Miami has no minimum orders?</h3>
                            <p><strong>Miami Alliance 3PL</strong> has no minimum order requirements. They work with brands shipping as few as 10 orders per month all the way up to 10,000+ orders per month. This makes them an ideal partner for startups, emerging DTC brands, and growing businesses that need professional fulfillment without volume commitments. Most other Miami 3PLs require 200-500+ monthly orders, which can be a barrier for early-stage companies.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>How do I compare 3PL pricing?</h3>
                            <p>To compare 3PL pricing effectively, request detailed rate cards from each provider and compare these specific line items: <strong>storage fees</strong> (per pallet or per cubic foot), <strong>pick-and-pack fees</strong> (per order and per additional item), <strong>receiving fees</strong> (per pallet or per unit), <strong>shipping handling fees</strong>, and any <strong>monthly minimums or account management fees</strong>. Calculate total cost per order at your actual volume &mdash; not just the per-pick rate in isolation. Watch for hidden costs like setup fees, integration fees, or long-term contract requirements. The most transparent 3PLs publish their pricing openly or provide instant online quotes.</p>

                            <h3>What's the best 3PL for Shopify in Miami?</h3>
                            <p>For Shopify brands in Miami, <strong>Miami Alliance 3PL</strong> and <strong>ShipBob</strong> both offer native Shopify integrations with real-time inventory sync and automatic order import. Miami Alliance 3PL is better suited for small-to-mid-size Shopify brands because of their no-minimum policy, transparent pricing, and dedicated account management. ShipBob may be a better fit for high-volume Shopify brands (1,000+ orders/month) that need multi-warehouse distribution across the U.S. to reduce transit times.</p>

                            <h3>Do Miami 3PLs offer same-day shipping?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. Several Miami 3PLs offer same-day shipping for orders received before the daily cutoff time, which is typically <strong>2:00 PM EST</strong>. Miami Alliance 3PL processes and ships all orders received by 2:00 PM the same business day. This is a standard offering among top-tier 3PLs in the Miami-Dade area. Always confirm the specific cutoff time and any product-type exceptions with your provider.</p>

                            <h3>How do I switch from one 3PL to another?</h3>
                            <p>Switching 3PLs involves several steps: <strong>(1)</strong> Review your current contract for termination clauses and notice periods. <strong>(2)</strong> Select and onboard with your new 3PL provider, including setting up integrations and sending test orders. <strong>(3)</strong> Coordinate an inventory transfer &mdash; your new 3PL can often arrange freight pickup from the old warehouse. <strong>(4)</strong> Run both 3PLs in parallel for 1-2 weeks to ensure continuity. <strong>(5)</strong> Redirect all new inventory shipments to the new facility. <strong>(6)</strong> Complete final reconciliation with the old provider. A good 3PL will manage most of this transition for you. Miami Alliance 3PL offers a dedicated onboarding specialist to make the switch seamless.</p>
