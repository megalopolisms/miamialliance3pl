A brand shipping 200 orders per month with 3-5 pallets of inventory can expect total 3PL costs of $500 to $1,500 per month before carrier shipping charges. Local Miami 3PLs generally offer 20-35% lower rates than national providers because of lower overhead, competitive market pricing, and Medley's industrial corridor cost advantages."

Miami Alliance 3PL, for example, accepts brands at any order volume with zero minimums and no long-term contracts. You pay only for what you use — storage per pallet and fulfillment per order — with no penalties for low-volume months.

National providers offer multi-warehouse distribution networks, which benefits brands with geographically dispersed customers. However, Miami's strategic location already provides 2-day ground shipping to 80% of the U.S., making a single Miami warehouse competitive with multi-location networks for most brands."

Some Miami 3PLs like Miami Alliance 3PL offer same-day onboarding for brands with straightforward product lines and local inventory.

                    <p class="article-lead">Miami has more than 200 third-party logistics providers within a 30-mile radius of the airport. They range from single-bay operations in Hialeah garages to 500,000-square-foot national distribution centers in Doral. Some are exceptional. Some will lose your inventory. The difference between the right 3PL partner and the wrong one is not marginal — it is the difference between a brand that scales smoothly into seven figures and a brand that hemorrhages money on reshipped orders, lost stock, and customer complaints that never had to happen. Choosing a <strong>3PL in Miami</strong> is one of the most consequential operational decisions an e-commerce founder will make, yet most brands spend more time picking a Shopify theme than evaluating their fulfillment partner. This guide gives you a structured, repeatable <strong>3PL checklist</strong> — ten specific criteria to evaluate before you sign anything, the red flags that should make you walk away, and a direct cost comparison between local Miami providers and national fulfillment networks. If you are shipping products and considering outsourcing logistics, this is the framework you need.</p>

                    <h2 id="why-it-matters">Why Choosing the Right 3PL Matters More Than Price</h2>

                    <p>The instinct when evaluating a <strong>fulfillment center</strong> is to compare per-order fees side by side and pick the cheapest one. That instinct is wrong, and it costs brands thousands of dollars every year. The per-order fee on a rate card is the smallest part of what a 3PL actually costs you. The real cost lives in everything that goes wrong — or right — after the contract is signed.</p>

                    <p>Consider what a single fulfillment error actually costs your business. A customer orders a blue crewneck in size Large. The warehouse ships a black hoodie in Medium. Now you absorb the cost of a return shipping label ($4-$8), the labor to process the return and restock the wrong item ($3-$5), the cost to pick, pack, and ship the correct item ($3-$5 plus a new shipping label), the customer service time to handle the complaint (15-30 minutes of someone's day), and the invisible cost that hurts the most — a 1-star review that sits on your product page for years, silently reducing your conversion rate by 5-10%. A single fulfillment mistake costs $15-$30 in hard dollars and potentially hundreds of dollars in lost future sales. At a 3% error rate on 500 orders per month, that is 15 mistakes — $225-$450 per month in direct costs, plus the cumulative brand damage of 15 unhappy customers sharing their experience online.</p>

                    <p>Now compare that to a 3PL with a 99.8% accuracy rate. The same 500 orders produce one error per month. One. The cost difference between a cheap, sloppy 3PL and a precise, reliable one is not the $0.50 per order you saved on the rate card — it is the $200-$400 per month you did not lose to preventable mistakes, plus the customer lifetime value you preserved by delivering a flawless experience.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">
                        <div class="callout-icon">📊</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>The True Cost of a Bad 3PL:</strong> E-commerce industry data shows that brands who switch 3PLs within the first 12 months cite accuracy problems (41%), hidden fees (28%), poor communication (18%), and technology failures (13%) as primary reasons — not high pricing. The cost of switching 3PLs — including inventory transfer, integration rebuild, and 2-4 weeks of operational disruption — averages $3,000-$8,000. Getting the decision right the first time is worth more than saving $0.25 per order.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The <strong>3PL checklist</strong> below is designed to prevent that scenario. It evaluates the factors that actually determine whether a fulfillment partnership will succeed or fail — not just the ones that show up on the pricing page.</p>

                    <h2 id="the-checklist">The 10-Point 3PL Evaluation Checklist</h2>

                    <p>Use this checklist when evaluating any 3PL provider in Miami or anywhere else. Each criterion is weighted by its impact on your operations. A provider that scores well on all ten is a strong candidate. A provider that fails on even two or three should be reconsidered carefully.</p>

                    <div class="article-steps">
                        <div class="step-card">
                            <div class="step-number">1</div>
                            <div class="step-content">
                                <h3>Location &amp; Proximity to Major Shipping Hubs</h3>
                                <p>Where your 3PL warehouse sits on a map directly determines two things: how fast your packages reach customers and how much you pay for shipping. Every mile between the warehouse and the customer adds transit time and carrier cost. A 3PL located near major interstate highways, the airport, and a deep-water port gives you maximum routing flexibility and minimum carrier rates.</p>

                                <p>In Miami, the sweet spot is the <strong>Medley/Hialeah/Doral industrial corridor</strong> — a dense logistics zone west of Miami International Airport. Warehouses here sit within 15 minutes of MIA (the busiest international cargo airport in the Americas), 25 minutes of PortMiami, and directly on the Palmetto Expressway and Florida Turnpike. Ground shipping from this corridor reaches Tampa and Orlando in one day, Atlanta and Jacksonville in two days, and the entire East Coast in three days. That geographic positioning means your customers get faster delivery, and you pay lower carrier rates because shorter zones equal cheaper shipping.</p>

                                <p><strong>What to ask:</strong> "What is your exact warehouse address? How far are you from the nearest UPS/FedEx hub? What percentage of U.S. addresses can you reach within 2 days by ground?" A good Miami 3PL should be able to reach 80% or more of the continental U.S. within 2-3 business days via standard ground shipping.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step-card">
                            <div class="step-number">2</div>
                            <div class="step-content">
                                <h3>Technology Integrations (Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce)</h3>
                                <p>Your 3PL's technology must connect seamlessly with the platforms you sell on. This is non-negotiable. If you sell on Shopify, the 3PL needs a native Shopify integration — either through an app or a well-documented API — that syncs orders in real time, pushes tracking numbers back to your store, and keeps inventory levels accurate across all channels. The same applies to Amazon Seller Central, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Etsy, TikTok Shop, and any other marketplace or platform you use.</p>

                                <p><strong>What real-time integration looks like:</strong> A customer places an order on your Shopify store at 10:14 AM. By 10:15 AM, the order appears in the 3PL's warehouse management system. By 2:00 PM, the order is picked, packed, and labeled. The tracking number pushes back to Shopify automatically. The customer receives a shipping confirmation email with tracking — all without you touching anything. If the 3PL tells you they "pull orders from a spreadsheet" or "sync orders once a day in a batch," walk away. It is 2026. Real-time integration is the baseline.</p>

                                <p><strong>What to ask:</strong> "Which e-commerce platforms do you integrate with natively? Is the integration real-time or batch? How long does setup take? Can you demonstrate the integration on a live account?" Also ask about multi-channel inventory management — can they fulfill Shopify, Amazon, and wholesale orders from a single inventory pool without overselling?</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step-card">
                            <div class="step-number">3</div>
                            <div class="step-content">
                                <h3>Pricing Transparency (No Hidden Fees)</h3>
                                <p>You should be able to calculate your total monthly 3PL cost with simple arithmetic before you sign a contract. The formula is straightforward: (number of pallets stored x storage rate) + (number of orders fulfilled x pick-pack fee) + (carrier shipping at negotiated rates). If a provider cannot give you clear per-pallet and per-order rates, or if their pricing involves "custom quotes based on a discovery call," proceed with extreme caution.</p>

                                <p>The most common hidden fees in 3PL contracts include: <strong>account management fees</strong> ($100-$500/month for access to your own account manager), <strong>inbound receiving surcharges</strong> (charging you per unit received rather than per pallet), <strong>long-term storage penalties</strong> (extra fees for inventory that sits beyond 90 days), <strong>label generation fees</strong> (charging $0.10-$0.25 per label printed), <strong>minimum monthly spend requirements</strong> (you pay a floor amount even if your volume drops), and <strong>technology access fees</strong> (charging for dashboard or reporting access). These fees can add 20-40% to your base cost and transform a competitive rate card into an expensive surprise on your first invoice.</p>

                                <p><strong>What to ask:</strong> "Can you give me a complete, line-item price sheet right now? Are there any fees not listed on the rate card? Is there a monthly minimum spend? What happens if my volume drops for a month — do I pay a penalty?" A transparent 3PL will hand you a one-page rate sheet and tell you to do the math yourself.</p>

                                <h3>Minimum Order Requirements</h3>
                                <p>Many 3PLs — especially large national providers — require 500, 1,000, or even 2,000 orders per month to accept your business. For a growing e-commerce brand doing 100-300 orders per month, this creates a painful choice: either inflate your volume to meet the minimum (spending money you do not have), or settle for a provider that accepts lower volumes but may lack the infrastructure of a larger operation.</p>

                                <p>The best approach is to find a <strong>Miami 3PL provider</strong> that has zero minimum order requirements but maintains professional-grade operations. These providers exist — they are typically mid-size, locally operated warehouses that serve the growing brand segment intentionally. They charge per order and per pallet with no floor, so you pay for exactly what you use. If you ship 30 orders one month and 300 the next, your costs scale proportionally.</p>

                                <p><strong>Miami Alliance 3PL has zero minimum order requirements.</strong> You can start with 10 orders per month and scale to 10,000 without changing providers. There are no volume commitments, no long-term contracts, and no penalties for low-volume months. You pay for what you use — nothing more.</p>

                                <p><strong>What to ask:</strong> "What is your minimum monthly order volume? What is your minimum monthly spend? If my volume drops below a certain threshold, do I pay a penalty or get moved to a different pricing tier? Can you show me examples of clients at my current volume level?"</p>

                                <h3>Order Accuracy Rate (99%+ Standard)</h3>
                                <p>Order accuracy is the single most important operational metric in fulfillment. It measures how often the warehouse ships the correct items, in the correct quantities, to the correct address. The industry benchmark for professional 3PLs is 99.5%. The best providers hit 99.8% or higher. Anything below 99% is unacceptable for an e-commerce brand that depends on customer reviews and repeat purchases.</p>

                                <p>The difference between 99% and 99.8% may seem trivial on paper. It is not. At 1,000 orders per month, 99% accuracy means 10 errors. At 99.8%, it means 2 errors. Over a year, that is 120 errors versus 24 — nearly 100 fewer angry customers, 100 fewer return shipments, and 100 fewer opportunities for a 1-star review. At $15-$30 per error in direct costs, the annual savings is $1,500-$3,000 before you even factor in the brand damage prevented.</p>

                                <p>How do professional 3PLs achieve 99.8%+ accuracy? <strong>Barcode scan-to-verify technology.</strong> Every pick is scanned. The warehouse management system compares the scanned barcode to the order requirement. If they do not match, the system physically blocks the packer from proceeding. This eliminates human error from the picking process. If a 3PL tells you they rely on visual verification (a person looking at the item and deciding it is correct), their error rate will be higher — no matter how experienced the team.</p>

                                <p><strong>What to ask:</strong> "What is your current order accuracy rate? How do you measure it? Do you use barcode scan-to-verify on every pick? Can you provide documentation or client references confirming your accuracy rate?"</p>

                                <h3>Same-Day Processing Cutoff</h3>
                                <p>Same-day processing means that any order placed before a specific daily cutoff time ships out that same business day. The cutoff time matters because it determines how fast your customers receive their packages. A 3PL with a 2:00 PM cutoff means a customer who orders at 11:00 AM has their package on a carrier truck by 5:00 PM. A 3PL with a 10:00 AM cutoff means that same 11:00 AM order does not ship until the next day — adding 24 hours to the customer's wait.</p>

                                <p>The best Miami 3PLs offer same-day processing for orders received by 2:00 PM EST with a same-day ship rate above 98%. This means that virtually every order placed before mid-afternoon leaves the warehouse that day. For e-commerce brands competing on delivery speed, this is critical. A customer choosing between your store (2-day delivery) and a competitor (4-day delivery) will choose you — and that choice is determined by your 3PL's processing speed, not your marketing.</p>

                                <p><strong>What to ask:</strong> "What is your same-day processing cutoff time? What percentage of orders actually ship same-day? Do you process and ship on Saturdays? Is there an extra fee for same-day processing, or is it included in your standard pick-pack rate?"</p>

                                <h3>Scalability: Can They Grow With You?</h3>
                                <p>Your 3PL needs to handle your current volume and your future volume without a painful migration. If you are shipping 200 orders per month today and expect to reach 2,000 within a year, the 3PL must have the warehouse space, staffing capacity, and technology infrastructure to handle that growth seamlessly. If they max out at 500 orders per month, you will be searching for a new provider right when your business can least afford the disruption.</p>

                                <p>Scalability also means handling demand spikes. Black Friday. A viral TikTok. A wholesale order from a national retailer. These events can 5x your normal daily volume overnight. A scalable 3PL has trained staff who can be reassigned, overflow storage capacity, and carrier relationships that can absorb volume surges without shipping delays. A 3PL that struggles to handle your Tuesday volume will collapse on Black Friday.</p>

                                <p><strong>What to ask:</strong> "What is your total warehouse capacity in square feet? How many orders per day can you process at peak capacity? What happens if my volume triples overnight — can you absorb that? How do you staff for peak season? Have you ever had a client outgrow your facility?"</p>

                                <h3>Specialty Services (Black Wrapping, Kitting, FBA Prep)</h3>
                                <p>Standard pick-pack-ship is table stakes. What separates a good 3PL from a great one is the ability to handle specialized fulfillment requirements that your brand needs — either now or in the future. The most commonly needed specialty services include:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Kitting and bundling:</strong> Assembling multi-item packs, variety packs, or subscription boxes from individual components. If you sell a "Starter Kit" that includes three different products packaged together, the 3PL needs to assemble that kit on demand.</li>
                                    <li><strong>FBA prep:</strong> Labeling, poly bagging, bubble wrapping, and palletizing products to Amazon's exact specifications for Fulfillment by Amazon shipments. FBA prep requires specialized knowledge — one labeling mistake can result in Amazon rejecting an entire inbound shipment.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Black wrapping:</strong> Opaque stretch wrapping that conceals pallet contents from view. Essential for high-value products, electronics, and brands that want to prevent theft and protect product identity during freight transit.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Custom packaging:</strong> Branded boxes, tissue paper, thank-you cards, promotional inserts, stickers, and other unboxing experience elements that turn a delivery into a brand moment.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Returns processing:</strong> Receiving returned items, inspecting condition, restocking sellable units, and updating inventory — all without you handling a single package.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>What to ask:</strong> "Do you offer kitting, FBA prep, and custom packaging? Is there an additional per-unit fee for these services? Can you show me examples of kitting or custom packaging you have done for other clients? How do you handle returns?"</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Communication &amp; Customer Support</h3>
                                <p>When a customer emails you asking where their package is and you need an answer from the warehouse in five minutes, not five hours, the quality of your 3PL's communication infrastructure becomes very real. The ideal 3PL provides a <strong>dedicated account manager</strong> — a named individual who knows your brand, your products, and your preferences — and who is reachable by phone, email, or chat during business hours.</p>

                                <p>Communication quality is also about proactive reporting. Does the 3PL notify you when inventory is running low? Do they flag unusual order patterns (a sudden spike or drop that might indicate a website issue)? Do they send daily or weekly fulfillment reports showing orders processed, accuracy metrics, and shipping performance? Proactive communication prevents problems. Reactive communication only manages them after customers are already affected.</p>

                                <p><strong>What to ask:</strong> "Will I have a dedicated account manager? What are their response times for email and phone inquiries? Do you provide a real-time dashboard where I can see order status and inventory levels? What reporting do you provide? Can I call the warehouse directly, or do I go through a call center?"</p>

                                <h3>Warehouse Tour &amp; Facility Condition</h3>
                                <p>Never sign with a 3PL you have not visited. A warehouse tour tells you more about a provider in 30 minutes than a month of sales calls. When you walk the floor, you are looking for specific indicators of operational quality:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Are storage locations clearly labeled? Are products neatly organized on racking, or piled haphazardly on the floor? Organized warehouses produce accurate orders. Chaotic warehouses produce errors.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Is the floor swept? Are the restrooms maintained? A warehouse that does not care about basic cleanliness does not care about the details of your order fulfillment either.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Temperature and climate control:</strong> If you ship products sensitive to heat or humidity (supplements, cosmetics, food, candles), the warehouse must maintain appropriate conditions year-round. Florida heat and humidity will destroy temperature-sensitive products in an un-air-conditioned warehouse.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Camera systems, controlled access, alarm systems, and visitor logs. Your inventory is your cash. It should be protected accordingly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Technology on the floor:</strong> Are workers using handheld barcode scanners? Are there computer stations at packing areas? Do you see a WMS running on screens? Technology on the warehouse floor is the visible evidence of the accuracy and efficiency you were promised in the sales meeting.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>What to ask during the tour:</strong> "Can I see the area where my inventory would be stored? Can I watch an order being picked and packed? What is your inventory shrinkage rate? When was the last time a pest control inspection was done? How do you handle product damage in the warehouse?"</p>

                            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Print this 10-point checklist and bring it to every 3PL evaluation meeting. Score each provider on a scale of 1-5 for each criterion. The provider with the highest total score is not always the cheapest — but they are almost always the best long-term investment. A 3PL that scores 45/50 at $3.00 per order will outperform a provider that scores 25/50 at $1.50 per order every single time.

                    <p>Knowing what to look for in a <strong>3PL in Miami</strong> is half the equation. Knowing what should make you walk away is the other half. In our experience working with brands who have switched from other providers, these are the most common warning signs that a 3PL will underperform:</p>

                            <p>If a 3PL refuses to let you tour their facility — or keeps pushing the visit to "after you sign" — there is a reason they do not want you to see the operation. Legitimate 3PLs welcome warehouse tours because a clean, organized facility sells itself. Refusal to show the floor is the single biggest red flag in 3PL evaluation.</p>

                            <p>Transparent pricing should be available before any sales conversation. If the 3PL's website says "contact us for pricing" and the sales team says "let's schedule a discovery call to build a custom proposal," they are either hiding fees or planning to charge you whatever they think you will pay. Rate cards should be straightforward and available upfront.</p>

                            <p>Ask point-blank: "What is your order accuracy rate?" If the answer is anything other than a specific number (99.5%, 99.8%, etc.), the 3PL either does not track accuracy or knows the number is embarrassing. Professional fulfillment operations track accuracy obsessively because it is the metric that determines client retention. A provider that cannot quote their accuracy rate is not measuring it — and if they are not measuring it, they are not managing it.</p>

                            <p>A 3PL that requires a 12-month contract with a $5,000 early termination fee is telling you something: they cannot retain clients through service quality alone. Confident providers offer month-to-month agreements. They know that if they deliver accurate, fast, transparent service, you will stay voluntarily. Contracts exist to trap you when the service fails — not to protect you.</p>

                            <p>If the 3PL's idea of "integration" is emailing orders in a spreadsheet or pulling them from an FTP site once a day, their technology infrastructure is a decade behind. Real-time API integration with Shopify, Amazon, and other platforms is the standard in 2026. Anything less creates inventory sync delays, overselling risks, and manual workarounds that introduce errors.</p>

                            <p>During the warehouse tour, count the packing stations. Count the staff on the floor. Look at the available racking space. If a 3PL claims they can handle 10,000 orders per day but you see three people in a 5,000-square-foot space, the capacity claim is fiction. What you see on the floor is what you get. Sales presentations lie. Warehouse floors do not.</p>

                    <p>If you are evaluating <strong>fulfillment center</strong> locations across the country, Miami deserves a hard look — especially if you sell to customers across the Southeast, East Coast, or Latin America. Here is why Miami's geography gives e-commerce brands a structural shipping advantage:</p>

                            <p>Miami sits at the southeastern tip of the continental United States, but its carrier infrastructure is world-class. UPS and FedEx ground from Miami reaches the entire Southeast (Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Alabama, Tennessee) in 1-2 days. The Mid-Atlantic corridor (Virginia, DC, Maryland, New Jersey, New York) lands in 2-3 days. Even the Midwest (Ohio, Illinois, Texas) receives ground deliveries in 3 days. The result: 80% of U.S. addresses are reachable within 2-3 days via standard ground shipping — no expensive air or express services required.</p>

Air freight from Asia, Europe, and South America clears customs at MIA and can be delivered to a Medley-area warehouse within hours, not days.</p>

                            <h4>PortMiami Access for Ocean Freight</h4>
                            <p>PortMiami is the closest major U.S. port to the Panama Canal and one of the busiest container ports on the East Coast. Brands importing container loads from China, Southeast Asia, or Central America benefit from shorter ocean transit times compared to West Coast ports (which also face chronic congestion). A container arriving at PortMiami can be drayaged to a Medley warehouse the same day it clears customs.</p>

                            <p>Miami is the commercial capital of Latin America. If your brand sells or plans to sell to customers in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, or the Caribbean, there is no better distribution base. Freight forwarders, customs brokers, and international carriers are concentrated here. Exporting from Miami to LATAM destinations is faster and cheaper than from any other U.S. city.</p>

                            <p>Florida has no state income tax, which benefits business owners who relocate or establish operations in the state. While this does not directly affect 3PL costs, it is a factor for founders who want their business operations and personal residence in the same tax-friendly jurisdiction.</p>

                            <p>Miami's Medley/Hialeah/Doral industrial corridor offers warehouse lease rates 20-40% lower than comparable logistics zones in Los Angeles, New Jersey, or Chicago. These savings are passed through to 3PL clients in the form of lower per-pallet storage rates. A pallet that costs $45-$65/month to store in a New Jersey warehouse costs $15-$40/month in Medley — a structural cost advantage that compounds every month.</p>

                    <p>One of the most common questions we hear from e-commerce brands evaluating <strong>how to choose a fulfillment center</strong> is whether to go with a local Miami 3PL or a large national provider like ShipBob, ShipMonk, or Deliverr. Both have their place. Here is a direct comparison so you can make an informed decision based on your specific needs:</p>

                    <p><strong>The key tradeoff is distribution reach vs. cost and flexibility.</strong> National providers operate warehouses in multiple cities (Dallas, Los Angeles, Chicago, New Jersey), which means they can ship from the location closest to each customer. This reduces average transit times for brands with geographically dispersed customer bases. However, this multi-warehouse approach comes with higher costs, split inventory management complexity, and less personal service.</p>

                    <p>For the majority of e-commerce brands — especially those shipping fewer than 2,000 orders per month — a single Miami warehouse provides excellent geographic coverage (2-day ground to 80% of the U.S.) at significantly lower cost. The savings on storage and fulfillment fees, combined with the benefits of dedicated account management and flexible terms, make a local <strong>Miami 3PL provider</strong> the stronger value proposition until your volume and customer distribution specifically demand a multi-warehouse strategy.</p>

                            <h3>What should I look for when choosing a 3PL in Miami?</h3>
                            <p>The most important factors when choosing a <strong>3PL in Miami</strong> are: location and proximity to major shipping hubs (airport, port, interstate access), technology integrations with your e-commerce platform (Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce), transparent pricing with no hidden fees, order accuracy rate (look for <strong>99.5% or higher</strong>), same-day processing capability, scalability to grow with your business, and specialty services like kitting, FBA prep, or discreet packaging. Always request a warehouse tour before signing to verify facility condition, organization, and security.</p>

                            <h3>How much does a 3PL cost in Miami?</h3>
                            <p>Miami 3PL costs typically include storage fees (<strong>$15-$40 per pallet per month</strong>), pick and pack fees (<strong>$1.50-$5.00 per order</strong>), and shipping at bulk-negotiated carrier rates (15-40% below retail). A brand shipping 200 orders per month with 3-5 pallets of inventory can expect total 3PL costs of <strong>$500 to $1,500 per month</strong> before carrier shipping charges. Local Miami 3PLs generally offer 20-35% lower rates than national providers because of lower overhead and competitive market pricing in the Medley industrial corridor.</p>

                            <p>It varies by provider. Many large national 3PLs require 500 or more orders per month, while some Miami-based 3PLs have <strong>no minimum order requirements</strong> at all. Miami Alliance 3PL, for example, accepts brands at any order volume with zero minimums and no long-term contracts. You pay only for what you use — storage per pallet and fulfillment per order — with no penalties for low-volume months.</p>

                            <p>For many e-commerce brands, a local Miami 3PL offers significant advantages: <strong>dedicated account management</strong>, lower pricing, the ability to visit your warehouse, faster onboarding, and more flexible specialty services. National providers offer multi-warehouse distribution networks, which benefits brands with geographically dispersed customers. However, Miami's strategic location already provides 2-day ground shipping to 80% of the U.S., making a single Miami warehouse competitive with multi-location networks for most brands shipping under 2,000 orders per month.</p>

The process includes account setup and e-commerce platform integration (1-2 days), shipping your inventory to the warehouse (2-5 days depending on origin), receiving and shelving your products (1-3 days), and running test orders to verify accuracy and packaging (1-2 days).
