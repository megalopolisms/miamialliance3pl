                    <p class="article-lead">FedEx has officially filed a lawsuit against the United States government seeking a full refund for all duties paid under IEEPA tariff authority. The lawsuit, filed just eight days after the Supreme Court's landmark 6-3 ruling that struck down IEEPA tariffs as unconstitutional, sends an unmistakable signal to every importer in America: the money you paid in IEEPA duties is recoverable, and the clock to file your own claim is already running. An estimated <strong>$142 billion</strong> was collected from IEEPA tariffs over 2025, and a substantial portion of that revenue will likely be returned to the firms that paid it. Here is what the FedEx lawsuit means, why it matters for your business, and exactly what you need to do right now.</p>

                    <h2 id="fedex-lawsuit">The FedEx Lawsuit: What Happened and Why It Matters</h2>

                    <p>On <strong>February 28, 2026</strong>, FedEx Corporation filed a formal lawsuit against the United States government demanding a complete refund of all customs duties it paid under tariffs imposed through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The filing represents one of the first major corporate actions to recover overpaid duties since the Supreme Court invalidated IEEPA tariffs on February 20, 2026.</p>

                    <p>FedEx is not a small player in this arena. As one of the world's largest logistics and shipping companies, FedEx acts as the <strong>importer of record</strong> on millions of shipments entering the United States each year. The company's exposure to IEEPA duties over the past year was enormous &mdash; spanning every product category, every origin country subject to IEEPA tariffs, and every port of entry where those tariffs were assessed.</p>

                    <p>The lawsuit argues a straightforward legal point: the Supreme Court has declared that IEEPA does not authorize the imposition of tariffs. Therefore, every dollar collected from FedEx under IEEPA tariff authority was collected <strong>without legal basis</strong>. The government is obligated to return those funds, plus interest.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#9878;</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>Why This Matters for You:</strong> FedEx's lawsuit is not just about FedEx. It establishes a public, high-profile legal precedent that validates what trade attorneys have been saying since February 20: <strong>every importer who paid IEEPA duties is entitled to a refund</strong>. The FedEx filing creates pressure on the government to establish a systematic refund process rather than forcing each importer to fight individually. But critically, you should not wait for FedEx's case to resolve before filing your own claim. Your filing deadlines are running independently.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The significance of FedEx choosing to sue &mdash; rather than simply filing administrative refund claims through CBP &mdash; signals that the company expects the government may resist or delay mass refunds. A lawsuit in federal court puts the issue before a judge, creates binding deadlines for the government to respond, and generates legal precedent that other importers can cite in their own claims.</p>

                    <p>This is not a speculative or uncertain legal theory. The Supreme Court has already ruled. The only question remaining is <strong>how fast</strong> the government will return the money &mdash; and whether importers will file their claims before the deadlines expire.</p>

                    <h2 id="scotus-foundation">The Legal Foundation: SCOTUS Strikes Down IEEPA Tariffs</h2>

                    <p>The FedEx lawsuit rests on the Supreme Court's decision issued on <strong>February 20, 2026</strong>. In a <strong>6-3 ruling</strong>, the Court held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president authority to impose tariffs on imported goods.</p>

                    <p>Since early 2025, the Trump administration had used IEEPA as its primary legal instrument for imposing sweeping import duties. The administration declared national emergencies related to trade deficits, fentanyl trafficking, and illegal immigration, then invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on goods from China, Canada, Mexico, and dozens of other countries.</p>

                    <p>The Supreme Court rejected this interpretation entirely. The majority opinion held that IEEPA authorizes the president to regulate, block, and freeze financial transactions and property interests during national emergencies. It does <strong>not</strong> authorize the imposition of customs duties. The power to levy tariffs is a function of trade law that belongs to Congress, not an emergency power the president can invoke unilaterally.</p>

                    <p>The ruling did not affect tariffs imposed under other legal authorities. Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods, Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, antidumping and countervailing duties, and the new Section 122 global tariff all remain valid. But the IEEPA-specific duties &mdash; which represented the vast majority of tariff revenue collected in 2025 &mdash; are now legally void from the moment they were first imposed.</p>

                            <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The Supreme Court did not merely say IEEPA tariffs should stop going forward. It ruled they were <strong>never legally authorized</strong>. This is a critical distinction because it means the duties collected were collected without legal authority from the start &mdash; creating an obligation for the government to return them with interest.

                    <p>The scale of the IEEPA tariff collection is staggering.

                    <p>The Supreme Court's ruling did not explicitly order the government to issue refunds. However, the Court <strong>did not rule out</strong> allowing importers to claim refunds on IEEPA tariffs already paid. This is a crucial nuance. By declining to shield the government from retroactive liability, the Court left the door open for exactly the kind of refund claims FedEx is now pursuing &mdash; and that every other importer can pursue as well.</p>

                    <p>Trade analysts and customs attorneys widely agree that a <strong>substantial portion</strong> of the $142 billion collected will ultimately be returned to the firms that paid it. The legal basis for refund claims is unambiguous: the tariffs were unconstitutional, the duties were collected without authority, and the importers are entitled to their money back.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-122-replacement">Section 122: The New Tariff Landscape After IEEPA</h2>

                    <p>While importers prepare to recover overpaid IEEPA duties, the trade landscape has already shifted. On <strong>February 22, 2026</strong> &mdash; just two days after the Supreme Court ruling &mdash; the administration invoked <strong>Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974</strong> to impose a new 15% global tariff on imports. The tariff took effect on <strong>February 24, 2026</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Section 122 is a fundamentally different legal instrument than IEEPA. It explicitly authorizes the president to impose temporary import surcharges of up to 15% to address large trade deficits. The administration cited the U.S. trade deficit &mdash; which exceeded $1.1 trillion in 2025 &mdash; as justification for invoking this authority.</p>

                    <p>But Section 122 comes with critical limitations that IEEPA did not have:</p>

                                <p>Section 122 tariffs can only last <strong>150 days</strong> without Congressional authorization. The clock started on February 24, 2026, meaning the tariff expires around <strong>July 24, 2026</strong> unless Congress acts to extend or replace it. This creates a built-in expiration date that IEEPA tariffs never had.</p>

For many importers, this represents a significant reduction from the IEEPA rates they were previously paying.</p>

                                <h3>Stronger Legal Foundation</h3>
                                <p>Section 122 is explicitly a trade provision designed for tariff actions. Unlike IEEPA, its authority to impose duties has not been challenged by the courts. However, some trade attorneys have raised questions about whether the administration's use of Section 122 meets the statute's specific requirements around balance-of-payments emergencies.</p>

                    <p>For importers, the transition from IEEPA to Section 122 means two things simultaneously: your <strong>future</strong> tariff rate may be lower (capped at 15% vs. the 25&ndash;50% under IEEPA), and your <strong>past</strong> IEEPA overpayments are recoverable. This is a rare situation where importers can benefit on both sides of the equation &mdash; but only if they take action to file refund claims.</p>

                                <p>For entries that have already been liquidated, your customs broker or trade attorney must file a <strong>CBP Administrative Protest (Form 19)</strong> at the port of entry within <strong>180 days of the liquidation date</strong>.

If denied, you can appeal to the Court of International Trade within 180 days.</p>

                            <strong>Do Not Wait for FedEx or CBP to Act for You:</strong> Some importers are assuming that the government will proactively issue mass refunds or that the FedEx lawsuit will create automatic relief for everyone. <strong>Neither is guaranteed.</strong> The safe approach is to file your own claims now. If CBP issues mass relief later, your individual filings become moot. If they do not, you have protected your rights. Missing your filing deadlines means losing your refund permanently.

                    <p>Filing IEEPA refund claims requires one thing above all else: <strong>organized, complete import documentation</strong>. Every PSC and protest depends on being able to tie specific entry numbers to specific IEEPA duty payments with accurate dollar amounts. This is where your 3PL warehouse partner becomes invaluable.</p>

                            <p>Every shipment arriving at a 3PL warehouse is logged with entry numbers, container numbers, arrival dates, quantities, and product descriptions. These receiving logs create a parallel documentation trail that helps you reconcile CBP entry data against physical goods received. When you need to prove that a specific import entry was assessed IEEPA duties and the goods were actually imported, your 3PL's records provide critical corroboration.</p>

                            <p>Many 3PL operations retain copies of entry summaries, commercial invoices, packing lists, and bills of lading as part of their standard receiving process. If your own records are incomplete &mdash; or if your customs broker's files are difficult to access on short notice &mdash; your 3PL's archives may contain the documents you need to assemble your refund claim quickly.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Why did FedEx sue the government instead of filing administrative refund claims?</h3>
                            <p>FedEx likely chose to file a lawsuit for several reasons. First, the amounts involved are extremely large &mdash; potentially hundreds of millions of dollars &mdash; which justifies the cost and complexity of litigation. Second, a lawsuit forces the government to respond on a court-mandated timeline, rather than the slower administrative process. Third, FedEx's case creates <strong>legal precedent</strong> that strengthens the position of every other importer seeking IEEPA refunds. For most importers, the administrative PSC and protest process through your customs broker is the appropriate path. Lawsuits are typically reserved for very large claims or cases where CBP has denied a protest.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Can I get a refund if I am a small business or low-volume importer?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. The right to a refund applies to <strong>every importer of record</strong> who paid IEEPA duties, regardless of business size or import volume. Whether you paid $5,000 or $50 million in IEEPA duties, you are entitled to a full refund plus interest. The filing process is the same: PSC for unliquidated entries, protest for liquidated entries. Your customs broker handles the actual filing. If you do not have a customs broker relationship, contact us and we can connect you with qualified brokers who are handling IEEPA refund claims.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>How much money can I realistically expect to recover?</h3>
                            <p>Your refund amount equals the total IEEPA duties you paid, plus interest accrued from the date of payment. To calculate your potential recovery: multiply your import value for each entry by the IEEPA tariff rate that was applied. For example, if you imported $100,000 per month in goods subject to a 20% IEEPA tariff over 12 months, your refund would be approximately <strong>$240,000 plus interest</strong>. Your customs broker can generate an exact figure from your entry records.</p>

                            <p>If you miss the deadline, you <strong>permanently forfeit</strong> your right to a refund on that entry. There are no extensions, grace periods, or exceptions. The 180-day protest window and 300-day PSC window are hard deadlines established by federal law. This is why immediate action is critical. Your earliest IEEPA entries from January and February 2025 may already have tight deadlines approaching. Audit your records and begin filing now.</p>

                            <h3>Does the FedEx lawsuit affect the Section 122 tariff I am paying now?</h3>
                            <p>No. The FedEx lawsuit concerns only duties paid under <strong>IEEPA authority</strong>, which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional. The Section 122 tariff (15% global) that took effect on February 24, 2026, is based on a different legal authority and is not affected by the IEEPA ruling or the FedEx lawsuit. You are required to pay Section 122 duties on current imports. The refund claims apply exclusively to past IEEPA payments.</p>

                    <h2 id="fedex-lawsuit">La Demanda de FedEx: Qu&eacute; Sucedi&oacute; y Por Qu&eacute; Importa</h2>

                    <p>El <strong>28 de febrero de 2026</strong>, FedEx Corporation present&oacute; una demanda formal contra el gobierno de Estados Unidos exigiendo el reembolso completo de todos los aranceles aduaneros pagados bajo aranceles impuestos a trav&eacute;s de la Ley de Poderes Econ&oacute;micos de Emergencia Internacional (IEEPA). La presentaci&oacute;n representa una de las primeras acciones corporativas importantes para recuperar aranceles pagados en exceso desde que la Corte Suprema invalid&oacute; los aranceles IEEPA el 20 de febrero de 2026.</p>

                    <p>FedEx no es un actor menor en este escenario. Como una de las empresas de log&iacute;stica y env&iacute;os m&aacute;s grandes del mundo, FedEx act&uacute;a como <strong>importador de registro</strong> en millones de env&iacute;os que ingresan a Estados Unidos cada a&ntilde;o. La exposici&oacute;n de la empresa a los aranceles IEEPA durante el &uacute;ltimo a&ntilde;o fue enorme &mdash; abarcando todas las categor&iacute;as de productos, todos los pa&iacute;ses de origen sujetos a aranceles IEEPA y todos los puertos de entrada donde se evaluaron esos aranceles.</p>

                    <p>La demanda argumenta un punto legal directo: la Corte Suprema ha declarado que la IEEPA no autoriza la imposici&oacute;n de aranceles. Por lo tanto, cada d&oacute;lar cobrado a FedEx bajo autoridad arancelaria IEEPA fue cobrado <strong>sin base legal</strong>. El gobierno est&aacute; obligado a devolver esos fondos, m&aacute;s intereses.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#9878;</div>

                            <strong>Por Qu&eacute; Esto Le Importa a Usted:</strong> La demanda de FedEx no es solo sobre FedEx. Establece un precedente legal p&uacute;blico y de alto perfil que valida lo que los abogados de comercio han estado diciendo desde el 20 de febrero: <strong>todo importador que pag&oacute; aranceles IEEPA tiene derecho a un reembolso</strong>. La presentaci&oacute;n de FedEx crea presi&oacute;n sobre el gobierno para establecer un proceso de reembolso sistem&aacute;tico en lugar de obligar a cada importador a luchar individualmente. Pero fundamentalmente, no debe esperar a que se resuelva el caso de FedEx antes de presentar su propio reclamo. Sus plazos de presentaci&oacute;n est&aacute;n corriendo independientemente.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>La importancia de que FedEx haya elegido demandar &mdash; en lugar de simplemente presentar reclamos administrativos de reembolso a trav&eacute;s de CBP &mdash; se&ntilde;ala que la empresa espera que el gobierno pueda resistir o retrasar los reembolsos masivos. Una demanda en un tribunal federal pone el asunto ante un juez, crea plazos vinculantes para que el gobierno responda y genera precedentes legales que otros importadores pueden citar en sus propios reclamos.</p>

                    <p>Esta no es una teor&iacute;a legal especulativa o incierta. La Corte Suprema ya fall&oacute;. La &uacute;nica pregunta que queda es <strong>qu&eacute; tan r&aacute;pido</strong> el gobierno devolver&aacute; el dinero &mdash; y si los importadores presentar&aacute;n sus reclamos antes de que venzan los plazos.</p>

                    <h2 id="scotus-foundation">La Base Legal: SCOTUS Anula los Aranceles IEEPA</h2>

                    <p>La demanda de FedEx se basa en la decisi&oacute;n de la Corte Suprema emitida el <strong>20 de febrero de 2026</strong>. En un <strong>fallo 6-3</strong>, la Corte sostuvo que la Ley de Poderes Econ&oacute;micos de Emergencia Internacional no otorga al presidente autoridad para imponer aranceles sobre bienes importados.</p>

                    <p>Desde principios de 2025, la administraci&oacute;n Trump hab&iacute;a utilizado la IEEPA como su principal instrumento legal para imponer amplios aranceles de importaci&oacute;n. La administraci&oacute;n declar&oacute; emergencias nacionales relacionadas con d&eacute;ficits comerciales, tr&aacute;fico de fentanilo e inmigraci&oacute;n ilegal, y luego invoc&oacute; la IEEPA para imponer aranceles que iban del 10% al 50% sobre bienes de China, Canad&aacute;, M&eacute;xico y docenas de otros pa&iacute;ses.</p>

                    <p>La Corte Suprema rechaz&oacute; esta interpretaci&oacute;n por completo. La opini&oacute;n mayoritaria sostuvo que la IEEPA autoriza al presidente a regular, bloquear y congelar transacciones financieras e intereses de propiedad durante emergencias nacionales. <strong>No</strong> autoriza la imposici&oacute;n de aranceles aduaneros. El poder de imponer aranceles es una funci&oacute;n de la ley comercial que pertenece al Congreso, no un poder de emergencia que el presidente pueda invocar unilateralmente.</p>

                    <p>El fallo no afect&oacute; los aranceles impuestos bajo otras autoridades legales. Los aranceles de la Secci&oacute;n 301 sobre bienes chinos, los aranceles de la Secci&oacute;n 232 sobre acero y aluminio, los derechos antidumping y compensatorios, y el nuevo arancel global de la Secci&oacute;n 122 siguen siendo v&aacute;lidos. Pero los aranceles espec&iacute;ficos de IEEPA &mdash; que representaron la gran mayor&iacute;a de los ingresos arancelarios recaudados en 2025 &mdash; son ahora legalmente nulos desde el momento en que fueron impuestos por primera vez.</p>

Esta es una distinci&oacute;n cr&iacute;tica porque significa que los aranceles cobrados fueron cobrados sin autoridad legal desde el principio &mdash; creando una obligaci&oacute;n para el gobierno de devolverlos con intereses.

                    <p>La escala de la recaudaci&oacute;n de aranceles IEEPA es asombrosa.

Esta cifra abarca aranceles sobre importaciones de China, Canad&aacute;, M&eacute;xico, la Uni&oacute;n Europea y pr&aacute;cticamente todos los dem&aacute;s socios comerciales sujetos a aranceles basados en IEEPA.</p>

                    <p>El fallo de la Corte Suprema no orden&oacute; expl&iacute;citamente al gobierno emitir reembolsos. Sin embargo, la Corte <strong>no descart&oacute;</strong> permitir a los importadores reclamar reembolsos por aranceles IEEPA ya pagados. Este es un matiz crucial. Al no proteger al gobierno de responsabilidad retroactiva, la Corte dej&oacute; la puerta abierta exactamente para el tipo de reclamos de reembolso que FedEx est&aacute; presentando ahora &mdash; y que cualquier otro importador tambi&eacute;n puede presentar.</p>

                    <p>Analistas comerciales y abogados aduaneros coinciden ampliamente en que una <strong>porci&oacute;n sustancial</strong> de los $142 mil millones recaudados ser&aacute; finalmente devuelta a las empresas que los pagaron. La base legal para los reclamos de reembolso es inequ&iacute;voca: los aranceles eran inconstitucionales, los aranceles fueron cobrados sin autoridad, y los importadores tienen derecho a que se les devuelva su dinero.</p>

                    <p>Mientras los importadores se preparan para recuperar aranceles IEEPA pagados en exceso, el panorama comercial ya ha cambiado. El <strong>22 de febrero de 2026</strong> &mdash; solo dos d&iacute;as despu&eacute;s del fallo de la Corte Suprema &mdash; la administraci&oacute;n invoc&oacute; la <strong>Secci&oacute;n 122 de la Ley de Comercio de 1974</strong> para imponer un nuevo arancel global del 15% sobre importaciones.

                    <p>La Secci&oacute;n 122 es un instrumento legal fundamentalmente diferente a la IEEPA. Autoriza expl&iacute;citamente al presidente a imponer sobretasas temporales de importaci&oacute;n de hasta el 15% para abordar grandes d&eacute;ficits comerciales. La administraci&oacute;n cit&oacute; el d&eacute;ficit comercial de EE.UU. &mdash; que super&oacute; los $1.1 billones en 2025 &mdash; como justificaci&oacute;n para invocar esta autoridad.</p>

                    <p>Pero la Secci&oacute;n 122 viene con limitaciones cr&iacute;ticas que la IEEPA no ten&iacute;a:</p>

                    <p>Para los importadores, la transici&oacute;n de IEEPA a la Secci&oacute;n 122 significa dos cosas simult&aacute;neamente: su tasa arancelaria <strong>futura</strong> puede ser m&aacute;s baja (limitada al 15% vs. el 25&ndash;50% bajo IEEPA), y sus <strong>sobrepagos pasados</strong> de IEEPA son recuperables. Esta es una situaci&oacute;n rara donde los importadores pueden beneficiarse en ambos lados de la ecuaci&oacute;n &mdash; pero solo si toman medidas para presentar reclamos de reembolso.</p>

                            <h3>&iquest;Por qu&eacute; FedEx demand&oacute; al gobierno en lugar de presentar reclamos administrativos de reembolso?</h3>
                            <p>FedEx probablemente eligi&oacute; presentar una demanda por varias razones. Primero, los montos involucrados son extremadamente grandes &mdash; potencialmente cientos de millones de d&oacute;lares &mdash; lo que justifica el costo y la complejidad del litigio. Segundo, una demanda obliga al gobierno a responder en un plazo mandatado por el tribunal, en lugar del proceso administrativo m&aacute;s lento. Tercero, el caso de FedEx crea <strong>precedente legal</strong> que fortalece la posici&oacute;n de todos los dem&aacute;s importadores que buscan reembolsos IEEPA. Para la mayor&iacute;a de los importadores, el proceso administrativo de PSC y protesta a trav&eacute;s de su agente aduanal es el camino apropiado.</p>

                            <p>S&iacute;. El derecho a un reembolso aplica a <strong>todo importador de registro</strong> que pag&oacute; aranceles IEEPA, independientemente del tama&ntilde;o de la empresa o volumen de importaci&oacute;n. Ya sea que haya pagado $5,000 o $50 millones en aranceles IEEPA, tiene derecho a un reembolso completo m&aacute;s intereses. El proceso de presentaci&oacute;n es el mismo: PSC para entradas sin liquidar, protesta para entradas liquidadas. Su agente aduanal maneja la presentaci&oacute;n real. Si no tiene una relaci&oacute;n con un agente aduanal, cont&aacute;ctenos y podemos conectarle con agentes calificados que est&aacute;n manejando reclamos de reembolso IEEPA.</p>

                            <p>Su monto de reembolso equivale al total de aranceles IEEPA que pag&oacute;, m&aacute;s intereses acumulados desde la fecha de pago. Para calcular su recuperaci&oacute;n potencial: multiplique su valor de importaci&oacute;n para cada entrada por la tasa arancelaria IEEPA que se aplic&oacute;. Por ejemplo, si import&oacute; $100,000 por mes en bienes sujetos a un arancel IEEPA del 20% durante 12 meses, su reembolso ser&iacute;a aproximadamente <strong>$240,000 m&aacute;s intereses</strong>.

La ventana de protesta de 180 d&iacute;as y la ventana de PSC de 300 d&iacute;as son plazos inamovibles establecidos por la ley federal. Por eso la acci&oacute;n inmediata es cr&iacute;tica.

El arancel de la Secci&oacute;n 122 (15% global) que entr&oacute; en vigor el 24 de febrero de 2026 se basa en una autoridad legal diferente y no est&aacute; afectado por el fallo IEEPA ni por la demanda de FedEx.
