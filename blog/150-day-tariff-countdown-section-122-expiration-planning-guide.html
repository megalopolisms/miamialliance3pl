                    <p class="article-lead">The clock started ticking on February 24, 2026. Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 limits the president's temporary import duty to 150 days without Congressional authorization. That means the 15% global tariff expires around <strong>July 24, 2026</strong> &mdash; unless Congress acts. For every importer in America, the question is the same: what do you do between now and then? This guide provides a decision framework for stockpiling, diversifying, accelerating imports, and positioning your supply chain for every possible outcome.</p>

                    <h2 id="why-150-days">Why the 150-Day Limit Matters</h2>

                    <p>Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 was never designed to be a permanent tariff mechanism. It was built as an emergency release valve &mdash; a way for the president to impose temporary duties for up to <strong>150 days</strong> when the country faces a large and serious balance-of-payments deficit. The statute explicitly caps both the rate (15% maximum) and the duration (150 days) of any duty imposed under its authority.</p>

                    <p>When the Supreme Court struck down IEEPA tariffs on February 20, 2026, and the administration invoked Section 122 just two days later, it chose the only legal tool that could impose broad tariffs quickly &mdash; but it also chose a tool with a built-in sunset. That sunset changes everything about how importers should plan.</p>

                    <p>Congress must pass legislation to extend, replace, or modify the tariff before the 150-day window closes. The current political landscape makes passage <strong>uncertain at best</strong>. The House and Senate are divided on trade policy. Business groups are lobbying aggressively on both sides. International trading partners are threatening retaliation. None of this guarantees a clean legislative outcome by late July.</p>

                    <p>This creates a window of <strong>maximum uncertainty</strong> &mdash; the worst possible condition for supply chain planning. Smart importers do not wait for clarity; they prepare for all scenarios simultaneously. The businesses that come out ahead will be the ones that built flexible strategies starting now, on Day 1 of the countdown.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#9878;</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>The Core Problem:</strong> You cannot know whether tariffs will be 0%, 15%, or 25%+ on July 25, 2026. But you must make purchasing, shipping, and warehousing decisions today that lock in costs for months. The only viable strategy is to plan for multiple outcomes and maintain the flexibility to pivot quickly when the political picture becomes clearer.

                    <h2 id="three-scenarios">Three Scenarios: What Happens on Day 151?</h2>

                    <p>Every importer's strategy should account for three possible outcomes when the 150-day window closes. Each scenario has different implications for your inventory, cash flow, and logistics planning.</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Scenario A: Congress Extends (Tariff Stays or Increases)</h4>
                            <p>This is the most aggressive case. Congress authorizes long-term tariffs &mdash; possibly higher than 15%. Political pressure from domestic manufacturing lobbies and trade hawks could push rates to 20% or 25% on certain categories. Importers who stockpiled inventory at the current 15% rate win big. Those who waited and are now importing at 20%+ pay significantly more per unit. <strong>Your hedge:</strong> Front-load inventory now while the rate is known and capped at 15%.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Scenario B: Tariff Expires, Nothing Replaces It</h4>
                            <p>The optimistic case. The 15% duty sunsets on Day 151 and Congress fails to pass replacement legislation. Importers who over-stockpiled have excess inventory at a higher landed cost &mdash; they paid 15% duty plus extra storage costs on goods they could have imported duty-free a few months later. But they maintained supply chain continuity and avoided the risk of being caught short. <strong>Your hedge:</strong> Use a 3PL with no-minimum storage so you can scale down quickly if tariffs drop.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Scenario C: Partial Replacement (Targeted Tariffs)</h4>
                            <p>The most likely middle ground. Congress passes legislation that imposes permanent tariffs on some product categories (electronics, steel, auto parts) while letting others revert to normal rates (textiles, agricultural goods, consumer products). This outcome requires the <strong>most flexible logistics strategy</strong> because your exposure depends entirely on what your specific products are. You need category-level analysis, not one-size-fits-all planning.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The critical insight is that <strong>Scenario C is most probable</strong> &mdash; and it is also the hardest to plan for, because it requires you to understand your product-level tariff exposure in detail. Importers who have not classified their products by tariff risk are flying blind into the most consequential trade policy window in decades.</p>

                    <h2 id="stockpiling-calculation">The Stockpiling Calculation: Math Every Importer Should Run</h2>

                    <p>The decision to stockpile is not emotional &mdash; it is mathematical. Every importer should run a simple calculation to determine whether front-loading inventory makes financial sense for their specific products. Here is the framework.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout callout-success">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#128200;</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>The Stockpiling Formula:</strong><br><br>
                            <strong>Extra Inventory Cost</strong> = (Units &times; Unit Cost &times; Tariff Rate Difference) vs. (Extra Storage Cost + Capital Carrying Cost)<br><br>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> You import 1,000 units per month at $50 each. The current tariff is 15%. If Congress extends the tariff to 25%, the 10% rate increase costs you <strong>$5,000 per monthly shipment</strong> (1,000 &times; $50 &times; 10%).<br><br>
                            Stockpiling 3 extra months of inventory now at 15% means importing 3,000 additional units. Monthly storage at a 3PL for those extra units runs approximately <strong>$800/month</strong>. Over 3 months of storage before you sell through: <strong>$2,400 in extra storage costs</strong>.<br><br>
                            <strong>The math:</strong> $2,400 in storage costs to avoid $5,000/month in extra tariffs = <strong>net savings of $12,600 over 3 months</strong> if the rate goes to 25%. Even if the tariff only stays at 15%, your downside is $2,400 in storage &mdash; a manageable insurance premium against a $15,000+ loss scenario.

                    <p>The variables that matter most in this calculation are:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Unit value:</strong> Higher-value goods generate larger absolute savings from tariff arbitrage. A $500 product saves $50 per unit at a 10% rate difference; a $5 product saves only $0.50.</li>
                        <li><strong>Margin:</strong> Products with 40%+ margins can absorb storage and carrying costs easily. Products with 10% margins cannot afford to carry excess inventory for months.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shelf life and obsolescence:</strong> Non-perishable goods with long product cycles are ideal for stockpiling. Seasonal products, fashion items, and perishables carry obsolescence risk that must be factored in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storage cost per unit:</strong> This varies dramatically by product size, weight, and storage requirements. A pallet of vitamins costs the same to store as a pallet of furniture &mdash; but the vitamins represent far more units and revenue.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Run this calculation for your top 10 SKUs. The answer will tell you exactly which products justify stockpiling and which do not.</p>

                    <p>Beyond the stockpiling math, every importer needs a structured framework for making decisions across the entire 150-day window. Here is a four-step process that works regardless of your product category or business size.</p>

Separate your catalog into three tiers: <strong>High risk</strong> (products likely to face permanent tariffs under any Congressional action &mdash; steel, aluminum, electronics, auto parts), <strong>Medium risk</strong> (products that could go either way &mdash; consumer goods, industrial supplies, chemicals), and <strong>Low risk</strong> (products likely to see tariffs expire &mdash; agricultural goods, medical supplies, products with strong domestic lobbying for exemptions).

For most importers, the break-even point is between 2 and 4 months of extra stock. Beyond that, storage and capital costs start to erode the tariff savings.

                    <h2 id="import-acceleration">Import Acceleration: When to Front-Load Inventory</h2>

                    <p>Import acceleration &mdash; deliberately pulling forward orders that would normally ship in Q3 or Q4 to arrive before the tariff expiration date &mdash; is the single most powerful tool available to importers during the 150-day window. But it is not right for every business or every product. Here is when it makes sense.</p>

                    <p><strong>The case for accelerating imports NOW:</strong> The current 15% rate is a known quantity. If Congress extends tariffs, the rate almost certainly goes up. By importing now, you lock in the lowest rate available during the uncertainty window. The earlier you act, the more capacity is available at current freight rates &mdash; both ocean and air carriers will see surging demand as July approaches, driving up transportation costs on top of any tariff changes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Products with high margins can absorb carrying costs.</strong> If your gross margin is 40% or higher, the cost of carrying extra inventory for 2-4 months (typically 1-3% of inventory value per month) is trivial compared to the potential 5-10% tariff increase you avoid. Run the math on your specific products. For most high-margin importers, the answer is clear: accelerate.</p>

                    <p><strong>Seasonal products that sell in Q3/Q4 should be imported now at known rates.</strong> If you sell products with peak demand in summer or holiday season, you need that inventory anyway. Importing it in March or April at a 15% known rate is strictly better than importing it in July or August at a rate that could be 15%, 25%, or 0% &mdash; you are eliminating uncertainty on goods you know you will sell. The only cost is a few extra months of storage, which is a rounding error for seasonal goods with strong sell-through.</p>

                    <p><strong>Work with freight forwarders to book capacity early.</strong> This is the element most importers overlook. As awareness of the 150-day deadline spreads, demand for ocean and air freight capacity will spike. We saw this pattern before the 2025 tariff escalations: importers who booked early got favorable rates, while those who waited paid 30-50% premiums for expedited shipping. Contact your freight forwarders now and reserve capacity for March through June shipments. The logistics crunch before July 24 will be severe.</p>

                            <strong>Timing Matters:</strong> Ocean freight from Asia to Miami takes 18-25 days. That means goods shipped on July 1 arrive around July 20-25 &mdash; cutting it dangerously close to the expiration date. To guarantee arrival under the current 15% rate, your last safe shipping date for ocean freight from Asia is approximately <strong>June 25-30, 2026</strong>. Plan your acceleration timeline accordingly.

                    <p>The most common response to tariff uncertainty is to wait and see what happens. It feels prudent. It feels cautious. It is, in fact, the riskiest strategy available to importers right now.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#9888;</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>The Wait-and-See Trap:</strong> If you do nothing and tariffs increase, you pay higher rates on every unit. If you do nothing and tariffs expire, your competitors who stockpiled are already selling at lower landed costs while you wait for new shipments to arrive. If you do nothing and demand spikes in June/July, you face port congestion, warehouse capacity shortages, and carrier rate surges that cost you more than any tariff premium.<br><br>
                            <strong>In every scenario, the importer who waited is at a disadvantage.</strong> The importer who stockpiled pays slightly more in storage if tariffs drop &mdash; a minor cost. The importer who waited pays dramatically more in tariffs, freight, or lost sales in every other scenario.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The logistics crunch before July 24 will be severe. History proves this. Before every major tariff deadline &mdash; the 2018 Section 301 escalations, the 2025 IEEPA tariff rounds &mdash; importers rushed to front-load shipments. The result was the same every time: <strong>port congestion, warehouse capacity shortages, carrier rate spikes, and customs processing delays</strong>. The importers who moved early avoided the crunch. The importers who waited got caught in it.</p>

                    <p>The same dynamic will play out before July 24, 2026. Except this time, the deadline is widely known months in advance, which means more importers will try to act &mdash; and the crunch will start earlier. Do not be the importer who tries to accelerate shipments in June and discovers that every warehouse in the port district is full and every carrier has a 3-week backlog.</p>

                    <p>Inaction is a choice. It is a choice to accept whatever tariff rate emerges, at whatever freight cost the market demands, with whatever warehouse capacity is left. It is the choice that feels safest and performs worst.</p>

                            <h3>How much warehouse space do I need for stockpiling?</h3>
                            <p>Calculate based on your current monthly throughput times the number of extra months of inventory you want to carry. For example, if you normally stock 30 days of inventory and want to build to 90 days, you need approximately <strong>3x your current warehouse footprint</strong> for those SKUs. A standard pallet position holds roughly 2,000-2,500 lbs depending on stacking. Miami Alliance 3PL can scale from 10 to 500+ pallets with no advance commitment, making it ideal for temporary stockpiling strategies where you need capacity fast and do not want to sign a long-term lease.</p>

                            <h3>What if I stockpile and the tariff expires?</h3>
                            <p>You will have extra inventory at a slightly higher landed cost due to storage and capital carrying costs. But you also <strong>avoided the risk of paying higher tariffs</strong> if Congress had extended or increased them, and you ensured supply continuity during a period when competitors may have faced stockouts or logistics delays. The downside of over-stockpiling is manageable &mdash; a few months of extra storage costs, typically 1-3% of inventory value per month. The downside of under-stockpiling if tariffs increase is much worse &mdash; higher duty rates on every unit for months or years, plus the competitive disadvantage of higher landed costs while rivals sell through cheaper pre-stockpiled inventory.</p>

La Secci&oacute;n 122 de la Ley de Comercio de 1974 limita el arancel temporal de importaci&oacute;n del presidente a 150 d&iacute;as sin autorizaci&oacute;n del Congreso. Eso significa que el arancel global del 15% vence alrededor del <strong>24 de julio de 2026</strong> &mdash; a menos que el Congreso act&uacute;e.

                    <h2 id="why-150-days">Por Qu&eacute; Importa el L&iacute;mite de 150 D&iacute;as</h2>

                    <p>La Secci&oacute;n 122 de la Ley de Comercio de 1974 nunca fue dise&ntilde;ada como un mecanismo arancelario permanente. Fue creada como una v&aacute;lvula de emergencia &mdash; una forma para que el presidente imponga aranceles temporales por hasta <strong>150 d&iacute;as</strong> cuando el pa&iacute;s enfrenta un d&eacute;ficit grande y serio en la balanza de pagos. El estatuto limita expl&iacute;citamente tanto la tasa (m&aacute;ximo 15%) como la duraci&oacute;n (150 d&iacute;as) de cualquier arancel impuesto bajo su autoridad.</p>

                    <p>Cuando la Corte Suprema anul&oacute; los aranceles IEEPA el 20 de febrero de 2026 y la administraci&oacute;n invoc&oacute; la Secci&oacute;n 122 solo dos d&iacute;as despu&eacute;s, eligi&oacute; la &uacute;nica herramienta legal que pod&iacute;a imponer aranceles amplios r&aacute;pidamente &mdash; pero tambi&eacute;n eligi&oacute; una herramienta con un vencimiento incorporado. Ese vencimiento cambia todo sobre c&oacute;mo los importadores deben planificar.</p>

                    <p>El Congreso debe aprobar legislaci&oacute;n para extender, reemplazar o modificar el arancel antes de que se cierre la ventana de 150 d&iacute;as. El panorama pol&iacute;tico actual hace que la aprobaci&oacute;n sea <strong>incierta en el mejor de los casos</strong>. La C&aacute;mara y el Senado est&aacute;n divididos en pol&iacute;tica comercial. Grupos empresariales est&aacute;n haciendo cabildeo agresivamente en ambos lados. Los socios comerciales internacionales est&aacute;n amenazando con represalias. Nada de esto garantiza un resultado legislativo claro para finales de julio.</p>

                    <p>Esto crea una ventana de <strong>m&aacute;xima incertidumbre</strong> &mdash; la peor condici&oacute;n posible para la planificaci&oacute;n de cadenas de suministro. Los importadores inteligentes no esperan claridad; se preparan para todos los escenarios simult&aacute;neamente. Las empresas que saldr&aacute;n adelante ser&aacute;n las que construyeron estrategias flexibles desde ahora, el D&iacute;a 1 de la cuenta regresiva.</p>

                            <strong>El Problema Central:</strong> No puede saber si los aranceles ser&aacute;n 0%, 15% o 25%+ el 25 de julio de 2026. Pero debe tomar decisiones de compra, env&iacute;o y almacenamiento hoy que fijan costos por meses. La &uacute;nica estrategia viable es planificar para m&uacute;ltiples resultados y mantener la flexibilidad para pivotar r&aacute;pidamente cuando el panorama pol&iacute;tico se aclare.

                    <p>La estrategia de cada importador debe contemplar tres resultados posibles cuando se cierre la ventana de 150 d&iacute;as. Cada escenario tiene diferentes implicaciones para su inventario, flujo de caja y planificaci&oacute;n log&iacute;stica.</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Escenario A: El Congreso Extiende (El Arancel Se Mantiene o Aumenta)</h4>
                            <p>Este es el caso m&aacute;s agresivo. El Congreso autoriza aranceles a largo plazo &mdash; posiblemente superiores al 15%. La presi&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica de los lobbies manufactureros nacionales y los halcones comerciales podr&iacute;a empujar las tasas al 20% o 25% en ciertas categor&iacute;as. Los importadores que acumularon inventario a la tasa actual del 15% ganan en grande. Los que esperaron y ahora importan al 20%+ pagan significativamente m&aacute;s por unidad. <strong>Su cobertura:</strong> Adelante inventario ahora mientras la tasa es conocida y tiene un tope del 15%.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Escenario B: El Arancel Vence, Nada lo Reemplaza</h4>
                            <p>El caso optimista. El arancel del 15% vence el D&iacute;a 151 y el Congreso no logra aprobar legislaci&oacute;n de reemplazo. Los importadores que acumularon en exceso tienen inventario extra a un costo de internaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s alto &mdash; pagaron el arancel del 15% m&aacute;s costos de almacenamiento extra en bienes que podr&iacute;an haber importado sin arancel unos meses despu&eacute;s. Pero mantuvieron la continuidad de la cadena de suministro y evitaron el riesgo de quedar cortos. <strong>Su cobertura:</strong> Use un 3PL sin m&iacute;nimos de almacenamiento para poder reducir r&aacute;pidamente si los aranceles bajan.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Escenario C: Reemplazo Parcial (Aranceles Selectivos)</h4>
                            <p>El punto medio m&aacute;s probable. El Congreso aprueba legislaci&oacute;n que impone aranceles permanentes en algunas categor&iacute;as de productos (electr&oacute;nica, acero, autopartes) mientras deja que otras vuelvan a tasas normales (textiles, productos agr&iacute;colas, productos de consumo). Este resultado requiere la <strong>estrategia log&iacute;stica m&aacute;s flexible</strong> porque su exposici&oacute;n depende enteramente de cu&aacute;les son sus productos espec&iacute;ficos. Necesita an&aacute;lisis a nivel de categor&iacute;a, no planificaci&oacute;n &uacute;nica para todos.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>La conclusi&oacute;n cr&iacute;tica es que el <strong>Escenario C es el m&aacute;s probable</strong> &mdash; y tambi&eacute;n es el m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil de planificar, porque requiere entender su exposici&oacute;n arancelaria a nivel de producto en detalle. Los importadores que no han clasificado sus productos por riesgo arancelario est&aacute;n navegando a ciegas en la ventana de pol&iacute;tica comercial m&aacute;s importante en d&eacute;cadas.</p>

                    <h2 id="stockpiling-calculation">El C&aacute;lculo de Acumulaci&oacute;n: Matem&aacute;ticas Que Todo Importador Debe Hacer</h2>

                    <p>La decisi&oacute;n de acumular no es emocional &mdash; es matem&aacute;tica. Cada importador debe hacer un c&aacute;lculo simple para determinar si adelantar inventario tiene sentido financiero para sus productos espec&iacute;ficos. Aqu&iacute; est&aacute; el marco.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout callout-success">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#128200;</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>La F&oacute;rmula de Acumulaci&oacute;n:</strong><br><br>
                            <strong>Costo de Inventario Extra</strong> = (Unidades &times; Costo Unitario &times; Diferencia de Tasa Arancelaria) vs. (Costo de Almacenamiento Extra + Costo de Capital Inmovilizado)<br><br>
                            <strong>Ejemplo:</strong> Usted importa 1,000 unidades por mes a $50 cada una. El arancel actual es del 15%. Si el Congreso extiende el arancel al 25%, el aumento del 10% le cuesta <strong>$5,000 por env&iacute;o mensual</strong> (1,000 &times; $50 &times; 10%).<br><br>
                            Acumular 3 meses extra de inventario ahora al 15% significa importar 3,000 unidades adicionales. El almacenamiento mensual en un 3PL para esas unidades extra es aproximadamente <strong>$800/mes</strong>. En 3 meses de almacenamiento antes de vender todo: <strong>$2,400 en costos de almacenamiento extra</strong>.<br><br>
                            <strong>Las matem&aacute;ticas:</strong> $2,400 en costos de almacenamiento para evitar $5,000/mes en aranceles extra = <strong>ahorro neto de $12,600 en 3 meses</strong> si la tasa sube al 25%. Incluso si el arancel solo se mantiene al 15%, su desventaja es $2,400 en almacenamiento &mdash; una prima de seguro manejable contra un escenario de p&eacute;rdida de $15,000+.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Las variables que m&aacute;s importan en este c&aacute;lculo son:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Valor unitario:</strong> Los bienes de mayor valor generan mayores ahorros absolutos por arbitraje arancelario. Un producto de $500 ahorra $50 por unidad con una diferencia de tasa del 10%; un producto de $5 ahorra solo $0.50.</li>
                        <li><strong>Margen:</strong> Los productos con m&aacute;rgenes del 40%+ pueden absorber costos de almacenamiento y capital f&aacute;cilmente. Los productos con m&aacute;rgenes del 10% no pueden permitirse llevar inventario excedente por meses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vida &uacute;til y obsolescencia:</strong> Los bienes no perecederos con ciclos de producto largos son ideales para acumulaci&oacute;n. Los productos estacionales, art&iacute;culos de moda y perecederos conllevan riesgo de obsolescencia que debe considerarse.</li>
                        <li><strong>Costo de almacenamiento por unidad:</strong> Esto var&iacute;a dram&aacute;ticamente seg&uacute;n el tama&ntilde;o, peso y requisitos de almacenamiento del producto. Una tarima de vitaminas cuesta lo mismo de almacenar que una tarima de muebles &mdash; pero las vitaminas representan muchas m&aacute;s unidades e ingresos.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Haga este c&aacute;lculo para sus 10 SKUs principales. La respuesta le dir&aacute; exactamente qu&eacute; productos justifican la acumulaci&oacute;n y cu&aacute;les no.</p>

                    <h2 id="scenario-planning">Marco de Planificaci&oacute;n de Escenarios para Su Negocio</h2>

                    <p>M&aacute;s all&aacute; de las matem&aacute;ticas de acumulaci&oacute;n, cada importador necesita un marco estructurado para tomar decisiones durante toda la ventana de 150 d&iacute;as.

Determine exactamente cu&aacute;ntos meses extra de inventario puede llevar de manera rentable. Para la mayor&iacute;a de los importadores, el punto de equilibrio est&aacute; entre 2 y 4 meses de stock adicional. M&aacute;s all&aacute; de eso, los costos de almacenamiento y capital comienzan a erosionar los ahorros arancelarios.

                    <p>La aceleraci&oacute;n de importaciones &mdash; adelantar deliberadamente pedidos que normalmente se enviar&iacute;an en Q3 o Q4 para que lleguen antes de la fecha de vencimiento del arancel &mdash; es la herramienta m&aacute;s poderosa disponible para los importadores durante la ventana de 150 d&iacute;as. Pero no es adecuada para todos los negocios ni para todos los productos. Aqu&iacute; est&aacute; cu&aacute;ndo tiene sentido.</p>

                    <p><strong>El caso para acelerar importaciones AHORA:</strong> La tasa actual del 15% es una cantidad conocida. Si el Congreso extiende los aranceles, la tasa casi seguramente sube. Al importar ahora, asegura la tasa m&aacute;s baja disponible durante la ventana de incertidumbre. Cuanto antes act&uacute;e, m&aacute;s capacidad hay disponible a las tarifas de flete actuales &mdash; tanto los transportistas mar&iacute;timos como a&eacute;reos ver&aacute;n una demanda creciente a medida que se acerque julio, aumentando los costos de transporte adem&aacute;s de cualquier cambio arancelario.</p>

                    <p><strong>Los productos con altos m&aacute;rgenes pueden absorber los costos de mantenimiento.</strong> Si su margen bruto es del 40% o m&aacute;s, el costo de mantener inventario extra por 2-4 meses (t&iacute;picamente 1-3% del valor del inventario por mes) es trivial comparado con el potencial aumento arancelario del 5-10% que evita. Haga las cuentas con sus productos espec&iacute;ficos. Para la mayor&iacute;a de los importadores de alto margen, la respuesta es clara: acelere.</p>

                    <p><strong>Los productos estacionales que se venden en Q3/Q4 deben importarse ahora a tasas conocidas.</strong> Si vende productos con demanda pico en verano o temporada navide&ntilde;a, necesita ese inventario de todos modos. Importarlo en marzo o abril a una tasa conocida del 15% es estrictamente mejor que importarlo en julio o agosto a una tasa que podr&iacute;a ser 15%, 25% o 0% &mdash; est&aacute; eliminando incertidumbre en bienes que sabe que vender&aacute;. El &uacute;nico costo es unos meses extra de almacenamiento, que es un error de redondeo para bienes estacionales con fuerte rotaci&oacute;n.</p>

                    <p><strong>Trabaje con agentes de carga para reservar capacidad temprano.</strong> Este es el elemento que la mayor&iacute;a de los importadores pasan por alto. A medida que la conciencia sobre el plazo de 150 d&iacute;as se difunde, la demanda de capacidad de flete mar&iacute;timo y a&eacute;reo se disparar&aacute;. Vimos este patr&oacute;n antes de las escaladas arancelarias de 2025: los importadores que reservaron temprano obtuvieron tarifas favorables, mientras que los que esperaron pagaron primas del 30-50% por env&iacute;o acelerado. Contacte a sus agentes de carga ahora y reserve capacidad para env&iacute;os de marzo a junio. La congesti&oacute;n log&iacute;stica antes del 24 de julio ser&aacute; severa.</p>

                    <p>La respuesta m&aacute;s com&uacute;n a la incertidumbre arancelaria es esperar y ver qu&eacute; pasa. Se siente prudente. Se siente cauteloso. Es, de hecho, la estrategia m&aacute;s riesgosa disponible para los importadores en este momento.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">

                            <strong>La Trampa de Esperar:</strong> Si no hace nada y los aranceles aumentan, paga tasas m&aacute;s altas en cada unidad. Si no hace nada y los aranceles vencen, sus competidores que acumularon ya est&aacute;n vendiendo a costos de internaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s bajos mientras usted espera que lleguen nuevos env&iacute;os. Si no hace nada y la demanda se dispara en junio/julio, enfrenta congesti&oacute;n portuaria, escasez de capacidad de almac&eacute;n y aumentos de tarifas de transporte que le cuestan m&aacute;s que cualquier prima arancelaria.<br><br>
                            <strong>En cada escenario, el importador que esper&oacute; est&aacute; en desventaja.</strong> El importador que acumul&oacute; paga un poco m&aacute;s en almacenamiento si los aranceles bajan &mdash; un costo menor. El importador que esper&oacute; paga dram&aacute;ticamente m&aacute;s en aranceles, flete o ventas perdidas en todos los dem&aacute;s escenarios.

                    <p>La congesti&oacute;n log&iacute;stica antes del 24 de julio ser&aacute; severa. La historia lo demuestra. Antes de cada plazo arancelario importante &mdash; las escaladas de la Secci&oacute;n 301 de 2018, las rondas arancelarias IEEPA de 2025 &mdash; los importadores se apresuraron a adelantar env&iacute;os. El resultado fue el mismo cada vez: <strong>congesti&oacute;n portuaria, escasez de capacidad de almac&eacute;n, aumentos de tarifas de transporte y retrasos en el procesamiento aduanero</strong>. Los importadores que se movieron temprano evitaron la congesti&oacute;n. Los que esperaron quedaron atrapados en ella.</p>

                    <p>La misma din&aacute;mica se repetir&aacute; antes del 24 de julio de 2026. Excepto que esta vez, el plazo es ampliamente conocido con meses de anticipaci&oacute;n, lo que significa que m&aacute;s importadores intentar&aacute;n actuar &mdash; y la congesti&oacute;n comenzar&aacute; antes. No sea el importador que intenta acelerar env&iacute;os en junio y descubre que cada almac&eacute;n en el distrito portuario est&aacute; lleno y cada transportista tiene 3 semanas de atraso.</p>

                    <p>La inacci&oacute;n es una elecci&oacute;n. Es una elecci&oacute;n de aceptar cualquier tasa arancelaria que surja, a cualquier costo de flete que el mercado exija, con la capacidad de almac&eacute;n que quede. Es la elecci&oacute;n que se siente m&aacute;s segura y rinde peor.</p>

                            <p>Depende de su margen, tipo de producto y costo de almacenamiento. Los productos con <strong>altos m&aacute;rgenes</strong> (40%+) y demanda predecible no estacional son fuertes candidatos para acumulaci&oacute;n a la tasa actual del 15%.

Los productos con m&aacute;rgenes delgados o alto riesgo de obsolescencia requieren an&aacute;lisis m&aacute;s cuidadoso. Un 3PL flexible con almacenamiento sin m&iacute;nimos le permite acumular sin riesgo de contrato a largo plazo &mdash; si los aranceles vencen, simplemente reduce.</p>

Por ejemplo, si normalmente almacena 30 d&iacute;as de inventario y quiere llegar a 90 d&iacute;as, necesita aproximadamente <strong>3 veces su espacio actual de almac&eacute;n</strong> para esos SKUs.

La desventaja de no acumular suficiente si los aranceles aumentan es mucho peor &mdash; tasas arancelarias m&aacute;s altas en cada unidad por meses o a&ntilde;os, m&aacute;s la desventaja competitiva de costos de internaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s altos mientras los rivales venden inventario pre-acumulado m&aacute;s barato.</p>
