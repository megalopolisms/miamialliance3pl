                    <p class="article-lead">Today is the day. At 12:01 AM EST on February 24, 2026, the most significant tariff transition in modern American trade history became official. Every IEEPA-based tariff &mdash; the reciprocal duties, the China surcharges, the Canada and Mexico additions &mdash; stopped being collected at midnight. In their place, a new 15% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 is now in force. If you import goods into the United States, this is your Day One briefing: what ended, what started, who is exempt, and what you need to do right now.</p>

                    <p>The past four days have produced more consequential trade policy changes than most years produce in total. Here is the exact sequence of events that brought us to today:</p>

                                <h3>February 20 &mdash; SCOTUS Rules 6-3: IEEPA Tariffs Unconstitutional</h3>
                                <p>The United States Supreme Court, in a landmark 6-3 decision in <strong><em>Learning Resources v. Trump</em></strong>, ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president authority to impose tariffs. The majority held that IEEPA's language authorizes the regulation, blocking, and freezing of financial transactions &mdash; but customs duties on imported goods are a function of trade law, not emergency economic powers. Every IEEPA-based tariff in effect was declared invalid. Global markets surged. Import-heavy stocks jumped. The dollar weakened against major currencies. Trade attorneys immediately began preparing refund claims for IEEPA duties already collected.</p>

                                <h3>February 20 &mdash; White House Issues 10% Tariff Under Section 122</h3>
                                <p>Within hours of the ruling, the administration pivoted to an alternative legal authority: <strong>Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974</strong>. President Trump signed an executive order invoking Section 122 to impose a <strong>10% temporary duty on imports</strong>, effective February 24, 2026. The order cited the U.S. trade deficit &mdash; which exceeded $1.1 trillion in 2025 &mdash; as justification under Section 122's balance-of-payments provision. Unlike IEEPA, Section 122 is explicitly a trade statute, making it a more defensible legal foundation.</p>

                                <h3>February 21 &mdash; Rate Hiked from 10% to 15%</h3>
                                <p>The following day, the administration raised the Section 122 rate to <strong>15%</strong> &mdash; the <strong>statutory maximum</strong> permitted under the Trade Act of 1974. This applies to approximately <strong>$1.2 trillion in annual imports</strong>, covering roughly 34% of all goods entering the United States. The justification remained the same: large and serious balance-of-payments deficit. At 15%, Section 122 is now fully utilized to its legal ceiling.</p>

                                <p>Customs and Border Protection issued formal guidance that <strong>IEEPA-based duty collections would cease at midnight</strong> on February 23-24. Ports of entry received updated instructions. Importers who had been subject to dual-collection confusion in the days since the ruling &mdash; some ports were still collecting IEEPA duties despite the Court's order &mdash; received confirmation that the old regime was officially over.</p>

                                <p>Today. Right now. The 15% Section 122 global tariff is in force. The IEEPA tariffs are history. Every import entering the United States from this moment forward is subject to the new duty structure. The <strong>150-day clock has started</strong> &mdash; this tariff expires around <strong>July 24, 2026</strong> unless Congress passes legislation to extend or replace it.</p>

                            <strong>Critical Timing:</strong> If you imported goods between February 20 and February 24 and were assessed IEEPA-based duties, you may have grounds to protest those assessments. CBP's initial response to the Supreme Court ruling was inconsistent across ports. Contact your customs broker or trade attorney immediately to review your entry documents from this window.

                    <p>As of 12:01 AM EST on February 24, 2026, <strong>every tariff that was imposed under IEEPA authority is no longer collected</strong>. The Supreme Court declared IEEPA an invalid legal basis for customs duties, and CBP has formally ceased collection. Here is what is gone:</p>

                            <h4>Reciprocal Tariffs (Most Countries)</h4>
                            <p>The broad "reciprocal" tariffs imposed on dozens of countries under IEEPA authority &mdash; which ranged from 10% to 50% depending on the country &mdash; are void. Countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America that were subject to these duties are now free of them. The only tariff they face is the new 15% Section 122 global duty.</p>

                            <p>The IEEPA-based surcharges specifically targeting Chinese goods are eliminated. However, this does not mean Chinese imports are tariff-free &mdash; far from it. Section 301 tariffs, the fentanyl-related 10% tariff, and the new 15% global tariff all remain. See the <a href="#china-situation">China section below</a> for the full layered picture.</p>

                            <p>The IEEPA-based additions to Canadian and Mexican tariffs are gone. However, Canada's 35% country-specific rate and Mexico's 25% country-specific rate may still apply to non-USMCA goods under other legal authorities. USMCA-compliant imports remain exempt from the country-specific rates.</p>

                            <p>The tariffs that were imposed under IEEPA citing immigration enforcement and drug trafficking as national emergencies are void. The Court was clear: IEEPA does not authorize tariffs regardless of the emergency cited. The fentanyl-related tariff on China (10%) remains because it was imposed under a different legal authority.</p>

                            <strong>Key Difference from IEEPA:</strong> Section 122 has a <strong>built-in 150-day expiration</strong> and a <strong>15% rate ceiling</strong>. Under IEEPA, the administration could impose tariffs of any rate for an indefinite duration. Section 122 provides a more constrained legal framework &mdash; which is exactly why the Supreme Court pointed to it as the appropriate mechanism for trade-deficit-related duties. The trade-off for importers: more legal certainty, but a hard clock ticking toward July 24.

                    <p>The balance-of-payments justification is significant. Under Section 122, the president can only impose temporary surcharges when the United States faces a "large and serious" balance-of-payments deficit. The administration's executive order cites the $1.1 trillion trade deficit in 2025 as the factual basis. Legal experts expect challenges, but Section 122 stands on firmer ground than IEEPA did for tariff purposes.</p>

                    <p>Not everything entering the United States faces the new 15% duty. The executive order includes a series of product-specific and trade-agreement-based exemptions that are critical for importers to understand. Here is the complete list:</p>

                    <p>This is one of the most critical provisions for importers with shipments currently on the water. The executive order establishing the Section 122 tariff includes a <strong>goods-in-transit exclusion</strong> that can save you 15% on incoming cargo &mdash; but only if you meet the requirements precisely.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout callout-success">

                            <strong>The Rule:</strong> Goods that were <strong>loaded onto a vessel and physically in transit before 12:01 AM EST on February 24, 2026</strong>, AND that are <strong>entered for consumption before the applicable deadline</strong>, are excluded from the new 15% Section 122 tariff. These goods are treated as if they arrived under the pre-February 24 regime.

                    </div>

                    <p>What this means in practice:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Your ship must have departed before midnight:</strong> The goods must have been loaded and the vessel underway before the effective date. Goods loaded onto a vessel on February 24 or later do not qualify, regardless of when the purchase order was placed or when the goods arrived at the port of loading.</li>
                        <li><strong>You must enter for consumption within the deadline:</strong> Simply arriving at a U.S. port is not enough. The goods must be formally entered for consumption through CBP within the timeframe specified in the executive order. Do not let goods sit in a bonded warehouse past this window.</li>
                        <li><strong>Documentation is everything:</strong> Retain all bills of lading, shipping manifests, vessel departure records, and AIS tracking data. If CBP challenges your goods-in-transit claim, you will need to prove the vessel departure date and loading date conclusively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Partial loads may qualify:</strong> If your container was loaded before the cutoff but shares a vessel with containers loaded after, your specific container may still qualify based on its loading date. Work with your freight forwarder to obtain container-level documentation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you have goods on the water right now, <strong>contact your customs broker today</strong> to verify the departure date and plan your entry filing strategy. The difference between entering one day inside versus one day outside the window is a 15% cost swing on your entire shipment.</p>

                    <p>The bottom line: depending on the product, Chinese goods face effective duty rates of <strong>25% to over 50%</strong> when all active layers are combined. Electronics, machinery, chemicals, textiles, and consumer products are the most heavily affected categories. The elimination of IEEPA surcharges provides some relief, but the remaining layers ensure China remains the highest-tariff origin for most product categories.</p>

                            <strong>China Strategy Consideration:</strong> With IEEPA surcharges gone but Section 301 + fentanyl + Section 122 still in place, the effective rate on many Chinese goods has actually decreased slightly from where it was before February 20. However, the 150-day clock on Section 122 means this rate structure is temporary. If Congress does not act by July 24, the 15% layer drops off &mdash; but there is no guarantee the administration will not seek alternative authorities to replace it. Continue diversifying sourcing away from China as a long-term hedge.

                    <h2 id="action-items">Immediate Action Items for Importers</h2>

                    <p>Today is not a day to wait and see. The tariff regime has changed, and the importers who act fastest will save the most money and avoid the most disruption. Here are six things you should do <strong>today</strong>:</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">
                        <div class="feature-item" style="border-top: 3px solid #dc2626;">
                            <h4>1. Contact Your Customs Broker TODAY</h4>
                            <p>Your broker needs to update your entry procedures immediately. The duty classification on every shipment entering the U.S. has changed. Confirm that your broker has received CBP's updated guidance, understands the Section 122 exemption list, and is correctly classifying your goods under the new regime. If your broker has not proactively reached out to you this morning, call them.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item" style="border-top: 3px solid #dc2626;">
                            <h4>2. Verify Which Products Are Exempt</h4>
                            <p>Cross-reference every product you import against the <a href="2026-tariff-exemption-list-products-exempt-15-percent-duty.html">Section 122 exemption list</a>. Pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, critical minerals, agricultural commodities, energy products, lumber, and goods under Section 232 orders are all exempt. Even partial exemptions on your product mix can save tens of thousands of dollars over 150 days.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item" style="border-top: 3px solid #dc2626;">
                            <h4>3. Review Goods in Transit and Entry Timing</h4>
                            <p>If you have shipments on the water, determine immediately whether they qualify for the goods-in-transit exclusion. Verify vessel departure dates, confirm loading dates with your freight forwarder, and plan your entry filing to fall within the exclusion window. A single day's delay in filing could cost you 15% on the entire shipment.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item" style="border-top: 3px solid #dc2626;">
                            <h4>4. Begin IEEPA Refund Documentation</h4>
                            <p>If you paid IEEPA-based tariffs at any point, those duties were collected under a legal authority the Supreme Court has now invalidated. The process for refund claims is still being established, but you should begin assembling your documentation now: entry summaries, duty payment records, IEEPA-classified assessments, and CBP receipts. Early filers will have the strongest claims.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item" style="border-top: 3px solid #dc2626;">
                            <h4>5. Adjust Pricing Models for 15% Duty</h4>
                            <p>If you were paying higher IEEPA rates, your landed costs may have actually decreased. If you were paying no tariffs or lower rates on certain goods, you now face a new 15% baseline. Either way, update your pricing models, communicate changes to your sales team, and recalculate margins. Do not wait until Q2 financials to discover the impact.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item" style="border-top: 3px solid #dc2626;">
                            <h4>6. Communicate with Suppliers About Sourcing Shifts</h4>
                            <p>The tariff reset creates new sourcing math. Countries that were under punitive IEEPA reciprocal tariffs are now at 15% flat. Countries that were previously untariffed are now at 15%. Run the numbers on your supplier portfolio and determine whether the new rate structure changes your optimal sourcing mix. Communicate with suppliers early &mdash; lead times for switching are measured in months, not weeks.</p>

                    <p>A tariff reset of this magnitude does not just change your duty bill &mdash; it changes your entire logistics strategy. Where you store goods, how you time entries, and whether you can access trade-zone benefits all become critical financial decisions. Here is how Miami Alliance 3PL helps you navigate each one:</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Foreign Trade Zone Access</h4>
                            <p>Miami-Dade County is home to one of the most active Foreign Trade Zones in the nation. Goods stored in an FTZ are considered outside U.S. customs territory for duty purposes. You can <strong>defer duty payments</strong> until goods enter domestic commerce, <strong>reduce duties</strong> using inverted-tariff provisions, or <strong>re-export without paying U.S. duties at all</strong>. In a 15% global tariff environment, FTZ strategies can save thousands per shipment &mdash; and the savings compound over a 150-day tariff window.</p>

                            <p>The 150-day clock creates a stockpiling incentive: if you believe tariffs will increase after Congress acts, importing now at 15% is the smart play. Miami Alliance 3PL offers <strong>no-minimum, no-long-term-contract storage</strong> that lets you scale from 10 pallets to 500+ without breaking a lease. When the tariff window closes or policy stabilizes, scale back down. You pay only for the space you use.</p>

                            <p>The tariff reset has changed the sourcing math for dozens of countries. With IEEPA reciprocal tariffs gone and a flat 15% Section 122 rate in place, <strong>Latin American sourcing has become more competitive than ever</strong>. Miami is the undisputed gateway to LATAM &mdash; PortMiami handles direct routes to every major Latin American port.

                            <p>The new tariff is <strong>15%</strong>, which is the statutory maximum under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. It took effect at 12:01 AM EST on February 24, 2026, and applies to approximately $1.2 trillion in annual imports. Section 122 has a built-in <strong>150-day limit</strong>, meaning this tariff expires around <strong>July 24, 2026</strong>, unless Congress passes legislation to extend or replace it.

                            <h3>How do tariffs on Chinese imports work after February 24, 2026?</h3>
                            <p>Chinese imports face a layered tariff structure: the <strong>10% fentanyl-related tariff</strong> (reduced from 20% via a November 2025 bilateral agreement), the <strong>new 15% global Section 122 tariff</strong>, plus pre-existing <strong>Section 301 tariffs</strong> that vary by product category (7.5% to 100%). Combined, many Chinese goods face effective duty rates of <strong>25% to over 50%</strong> depending on classification. The IEEPA-specific China surcharges are gone, which provides some marginal relief, but the remaining layers ensure China remains the highest-tariff major trading partner.</p>

                                <p>La Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos, en una decisi&oacute;n hist&oacute;rica de 6-3 en <strong><em>Learning Resources v. Trump</em></strong>, dict&oacute; que la Ley de Poderes Econ&oacute;micos de Emergencia Internacional no otorga al presidente autoridad para imponer aranceles. La mayor&iacute;a sostuvo que el lenguaje de IEEPA autoriza la regulaci&oacute;n, bloqueo y congelamiento de transacciones financieras &mdash; pero los aranceles aduaneros sobre bienes importados son una funci&oacute;n de la ley comercial, no de poderes econ&oacute;micos de emergencia. Todos los aranceles basados en IEEPA vigentes fueron declarados inv&aacute;lidos. Los mercados globales se dispararon. Las acciones de empresas dependientes de importaciones subieron. El d&oacute;lar se debilit&oacute; frente a las principales monedas. Los abogados de comercio comenzaron inmediatamente a preparar reclamos de reembolso por los aranceles IEEPA ya cobrados.</p>

                                <p>Pocas horas despu&eacute;s del fallo, la administraci&oacute;n pivot&oacute; a una autoridad legal alternativa: <strong>la Secci&oacute;n 122 de la Ley de Comercio de 1974</strong>. El Presidente Trump firm&oacute; una orden ejecutiva invocando la Secci&oacute;n 122 para imponer un <strong>arancel temporal del 10% sobre importaciones</strong>, efectivo el 24 de febrero de 2026. La orden cit&oacute; el d&eacute;ficit comercial de EE.UU. &mdash; que super&oacute; los $1.1 billones en 2025 &mdash; como justificaci&oacute;n bajo la disposici&oacute;n de balanza de pagos de la Secci&oacute;n 122. A diferencia de IEEPA, la Secci&oacute;n 122 es expl&iacute;citamente un estatuto comercial, lo que la convierte en una base legal m&aacute;s defendible.</p>

                    <p>A partir de las 12:01 AM EST del 24 de febrero de 2026, <strong>todo arancel impuesto bajo autoridad IEEPA ya no se cobra</strong>.

                            <p>Los amplios aranceles "rec&iacute;procos" impuestos sobre docenas de pa&iacute;ses bajo autoridad IEEPA &mdash; que oscilaban entre 10% y 50% dependiendo del pa&iacute;s &mdash; est&aacute;n anulados. Pa&iacute;ses en Europa, Asia, &Aacute;frica y Am&eacute;rica del Sur que estaban sujetos a estos aranceles ahora est&aacute;n libres de ellos.

Sin embargo, esto no significa que las importaciones chinas est&eacute;n libres de aranceles &mdash; todo lo contrario.

La Corte fue clara: IEEPA no autoriza aranceles independientemente de la emergencia citada. El arancel relacionado con el fentanilo sobre China (10%) permanece porque fue impuesto bajo una autoridad legal diferente.</p>

Bajo IEEPA, la administraci&oacute;n pod&iacute;a imponer aranceles de cualquier tasa por duraci&oacute;n indefinida.

                    <p>La justificaci&oacute;n de balanza de pagos es significativa. Bajo la Secci&oacute;n 122, el presidente solo puede imponer sobretasas temporales cuando Estados Unidos enfrenta un d&eacute;ficit "grande y serio" en la balanza de pagos. La orden ejecutiva de la administraci&oacute;n cita el d&eacute;ficit comercial de $1.1 billones en 2025 como base factual. Los expertos legales esperan desaf&iacute;os, pero la Secci&oacute;n 122 se sostiene sobre terreno m&aacute;s firme que IEEPA para prop&oacute;sitos arancelarios.</p>

                    <p>Esta es una de las disposiciones m&aacute;s cr&iacute;ticas para importadores con env&iacute;os actualmente en el agua. La orden ejecutiva que establece el arancel de la Secci&oacute;n 122 incluye una <strong>exclusi&oacute;n de bienes en tr&aacute;nsito</strong> que puede ahorrarle el 15% en carga entrante &mdash; pero solo si cumple los requisitos con precisi&oacute;n.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout callout-success">

                            <strong>La Regla:</strong> Los bienes que fueron <strong>cargados en un buque y f&iacute;sicamente en tr&aacute;nsito antes de las 12:01 AM EST del 24 de febrero de 2026</strong>, Y que se <strong>ingresen para consumo antes del plazo aplicable</strong>, est&aacute;n excluidos del nuevo arancel del 15% de la Secci&oacute;n 122. Estos bienes se tratan como si hubieran llegado bajo el r&eacute;gimen anterior al 24 de febrero.

                    </div>

                    <p>Lo que esto significa en la pr&aacute;ctica:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Su buque debe haber zarpado antes de medianoche:</strong> Los bienes deben haber sido cargados y el buque en camino antes de la fecha efectiva. Los bienes cargados en un buque el 24 de febrero o despu&eacute;s no califican, independientemente de cu&aacute;ndo se hizo la orden de compra o cu&aacute;ndo llegaron los bienes al puerto de carga.</li>
                        <li><strong>Debe ingresar para consumo dentro del plazo:</strong> Simplemente llegar a un puerto de EE.UU. no es suficiente. Los bienes deben ser formalmente ingresados para consumo a trav&eacute;s de CBP dentro del plazo especificado en la orden ejecutiva. No deje bienes en un almac&eacute;n fiscal m&aacute;s all&aacute; de esta ventana.</li>
                        <li><strong>La documentaci&oacute;n es todo:</strong> Conserve todos los conocimientos de embarque, manifiestos de env&iacute;o, registros de salida del buque y datos de rastreo AIS. Si CBP impugna su reclamo de bienes en tr&aacute;nsito, necesitar&aacute; probar la fecha de salida del buque y la fecha de carga de manera concluyente.</li>
                        <li><strong>Las cargas parciales pueden calificar:</strong> Si su contenedor fue cargado antes del plazo pero comparte un buque con contenedores cargados despu&eacute;s, su contenedor espec&iacute;fico puede a&uacute;n calificar basado en su fecha de carga. Trabaje con su agente de carga para obtener documentaci&oacute;n a nivel de contenedor.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Si tiene bienes en el agua en este momento, <strong>contacte a su agente aduanal hoy</strong> para verificar la fecha de salida y planificar su estrategia de presentaci&oacute;n de entrada. La diferencia entre ingresar un d&iacute;a dentro versus un d&iacute;a fuera de la ventana es un 15% de variaci&oacute;n de costo en todo su env&iacute;o.</p>

                    <p>Si importa de China, la eliminaci&oacute;n de aranceles IEEPA <strong>no</strong> significa que sus costos hayan bajado.

                    <p>La conclusi&oacute;n: dependiendo del producto, los bienes chinos enfrentan tasas arancelarias efectivas del <strong>25% a m&aacute;s del 50%</strong> cuando se combinan todas las capas activas. Electr&oacute;nica, maquinaria, qu&iacute;micos, textiles y productos de consumo son las categor&iacute;as m&aacute;s afectadas. La eliminaci&oacute;n de los recargos IEEPA proporciona algo de alivio, pero las capas restantes aseguran que China siga siendo el origen con los aranceles m&aacute;s altos para la mayor&iacute;a de las categor&iacute;as de productos.</p>

Sin embargo, el reloj de 150 d&iacute;as sobre la Secci&oacute;n 122 significa que esta estructura de tasas es temporal. Si el Congreso no act&uacute;a para el 24 de julio, la capa del 15% desaparece &mdash; pero no hay garant&iacute;a de que la administraci&oacute;n no buscar&aacute; autoridades alternativas para reemplazarla. Contin&uacute;e diversificando su abastecimiento lejos de China como cobertura a largo plazo.

                    <p>Hoy no es un d&iacute;a para esperar y ver.

                            <p>Su agente necesita actualizar sus procedimientos de entrada inmediatamente. La clasificaci&oacute;n arancelaria de cada env&iacute;o que ingresa a EE.UU. ha cambiado. Confirme que su agente ha recibido la gu&iacute;a actualizada de CBP, entiende la lista de exenciones de la Secci&oacute;n 122 y est&aacute; clasificando correctamente sus bienes bajo el nuevo r&eacute;gimen. Si su agente no le ha contactado proactivamente esta ma&ntilde;ana, ll&aacute;melo.</p>

                            <h4>2. Verifique Qu&eacute; Productos Est&aacute;n Exentos</h4>
                            <p>Cruce cada producto que importa contra la <a href="2026-tariff-exemption-list-products-exempt-15-percent-duty.html">lista de exenciones de la Secci&oacute;n 122</a>. Farmac&eacute;uticos, semiconductores, minerales cr&iacute;ticos, productos agr&iacute;colas, productos energ&eacute;ticos, madera y bienes bajo &oacute;rdenes de la Secci&oacute;n 232 est&aacute;n todos exentos.

                            <h4>3. Revise Bienes en Tr&aacute;nsito y Timing de Entrada</h4>
                            <p>Si tiene env&iacute;os en el agua, determine inmediatamente si califican para la exclusi&oacute;n de bienes en tr&aacute;nsito. Verifique fechas de salida del buque, confirme fechas de carga con su agente de carga y planifique su presentaci&oacute;n de entrada para caer dentro de la ventana de exclusi&oacute;n. Un solo d&iacute;a de retraso en la presentaci&oacute;n podr&iacute;a costarle el 15% en todo el env&iacute;o.</p>

                            <h4>4. Inicie la Documentaci&oacute;n de Reembolso IEEPA</h4>
                            <p>Si pag&oacute; aranceles basados en IEEPA en cualquier momento, esos aranceles se cobraron bajo una autoridad legal que la Corte Suprema ahora ha invalidado. El proceso de reclamos de reembolso a&uacute;n se est&aacute; estableciendo, pero debe comenzar a reunir su documentaci&oacute;n ahora: res&uacute;menes de entrada, registros de pago de aranceles, evaluaciones clasificadas bajo IEEPA y recibos de CBP. Los que presenten primero tendr&aacute;n los reclamos m&aacute;s fuertes.</p>

                            <h4>5. Ajuste Modelos de Precios para el Arancel del 15%</h4>
                            <p>Si estaba pagando tasas IEEPA m&aacute;s altas, sus costos de internaci&oacute;n pueden haber disminuido. Si estaba pagando ninguno o aranceles m&aacute;s bajos en ciertos bienes, ahora enfrenta una base del 15%. De cualquier manera, actualice sus modelos de precios, comunique los cambios a su equipo de ventas y recalcule m&aacute;rgenes. No espere hasta los estados financieros del Q2 para descubrir el impacto.</p>

                            <p>El reinicio arancelario crea nuevas matem&aacute;ticas de abastecimiento. Pa&iacute;ses que estaban bajo aranceles rec&iacute;procos IEEPA punitivos ahora est&aacute;n al 15% plano. Pa&iacute;ses que previamente no ten&iacute;an aranceles ahora est&aacute;n al 15%. Ejecute los n&uacute;meros de su portafolio de proveedores y determine si la nueva estructura de tasas cambia su mezcla &oacute;ptima de abastecimiento. Comunique a los proveedores temprano &mdash; los tiempos de entrega para cambiar se miden en meses, no semanas.</p>

                    <p>Un reinicio arancelario de esta magnitud no solo cambia su factura de aranceles &mdash; cambia toda su estrategia log&iacute;stica. D&oacute;nde almacena bienes, c&oacute;mo programa las entradas y si puede acceder a beneficios de zona de comercio se convierten en decisiones financieras cr&iacute;ticas. As&iacute; es como Miami Alliance 3PL le ayuda a navegar cada una:</p>

                            <h4>Acceso a Zona de Comercio Exterior</h4>
                            <p>El condado de Miami-Dade es hogar de una de las Zonas de Comercio Exterior m&aacute;s activas de la naci&oacute;n. Los bienes almacenados en una FTZ se consideran fuera del territorio aduanero de EE.UU. para efectos arancelarios. Puede <strong>diferir pagos de aranceles</strong> hasta que los bienes entren en comercio dom&eacute;stico, <strong>reducir aranceles</strong> usando disposiciones de aranceles invertidos, o <strong>reexportar sin pagar aranceles de EE.UU.</strong>. En un entorno de arancel global del 15%, las estrategias FTZ pueden ahorrar miles por env&iacute;o &mdash; y los ahorros se componen durante una ventana arancelaria de 150 d&iacute;as.</p>

                            <h4>Almacenamiento Flexible para Acumulaci&oacute;n</h4>
                            <p>El reloj de 150 d&iacute;as crea un incentivo de acumulaci&oacute;n: si cree que los aranceles aumentar&aacute;n despu&eacute;s de que el Congreso act&uacute;e, importar ahora al 15% es la jugada inteligente. Miami Alliance 3PL ofrece <strong>almacenamiento sin m&iacute;nimos y sin contratos a largo plazo</strong> que le permite escalar de 10 tarimas a 500+ sin romper un contrato. Cuando la ventana arancelaria se cierre o la pol&iacute;tica se estabilice, reduzca. Paga solo por el espacio que usa.</p>

Le ayudamos a <strong>programar sus entradas</strong> para maximizar las exclusiones de bienes en tr&aacute;nsito, <strong>verificar que las exenciones</strong> se reclamen correctamente y <strong>evitar errores de doble evaluaci&oacute;n</strong> que afectaron a los importadores en la ventana de transici&oacute;n del 20 al 24 de febrero.</p>

                            <p>El reinicio arancelario ha cambiado las matem&aacute;ticas de abastecimiento para docenas de pa&iacute;ses. Con los aranceles rec&iacute;procos IEEPA eliminados y una tasa plana del 15% de la Secci&oacute;n 122, <strong>el abastecimiento desde Am&eacute;rica Latina se ha vuelto m&aacute;s competitivo que nunca</strong>. Miami es la puerta de entrada indiscutible a LATAM &mdash; PortMiami maneja rutas directas a todos los principales puertos latinoamericanos. Los bienes de Colombia, Brasil, Chile y el resto de la regi&oacute;n llegan en d&iacute;as, pasan aduanas m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido y llegan a sus clientes antes.</p>

Esto incluye <strong>aranceles rec&iacute;procos sobre la mayor&iacute;a de pa&iacute;ses</strong>, <strong>recargos IEEPA espec&iacute;ficos para China</strong>, las <strong>adiciones IEEPA a Canad&aacute; y M&eacute;xico</strong>, y los <strong>aranceles de tr&aacute;fico e inmigraci&oacute;n</strong>. CBP dej&oacute; de cobrar aranceles IEEPA a medianoche del 23-24 de febrero, tras el fallo 6-3 de la Corte Suprema en <em>Learning Resources v. Trump</em> el 20 de febrero.

                            <p>El nuevo arancel es del <strong>15%</strong>, que es el m&aacute;ximo legal bajo la Secci&oacute;n 122 de la Ley de Comercio de 1974.

La tasa no puede aumentarse por encima del 15% sin acci&oacute;n del Congreso.</p>

                            <p>Las importaciones chinas enfrentan una estructura arancelaria escalonada: el <strong>arancel del 10% relacionado con fentanilo</strong> (reducido del 20% por acuerdo bilateral de noviembre 2025), el <strong>nuevo arancel global del 15% de la Secci&oacute;n 122</strong>, m&aacute;s los <strong>aranceles preexistentes de la Secci&oacute;n 301</strong> que var&iacute;an por categor&iacute;a de producto (7.5% a 100%). Combinados, muchos bienes chinos enfrentan tasas arancelarias efectivas del <strong>25% a m&aacute;s del 50%</strong> dependiendo de la clasificaci&oacute;n. Los recargos IEEPA espec&iacute;ficos para China desaparecieron, lo que proporciona algo de alivio marginal, pero las capas restantes aseguran que China siga siendo el socio comercial principal con los aranceles m&aacute;s altos.</p>
