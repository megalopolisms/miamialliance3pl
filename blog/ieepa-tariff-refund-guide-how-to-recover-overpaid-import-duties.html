                    <h2 id="the-ruling">The Ruling That Changed Everything</h2>

                    <p>On <strong>February 20, 2026</strong>, the United States Supreme Court handed down the most consequential trade decision in modern American history. In a <strong>6-3 ruling</strong> in <em>Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump</em>, the Court held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the authority to impose tariffs on imported goods.</p>

                    <p>The IEEPA, enacted in 1977, gives the president broad powers to regulate economic transactions during declared national emergencies. Since early 2025, the Trump administration had relied on IEEPA as the legal foundation for sweeping tariffs on imports from China, Canada, Mexico, and dozens of other countries &mdash; citing national emergencies related to trade deficits, fentanyl trafficking, and immigration.</p>

                    <p>The Supreme Court disagreed with this interpretation. The majority opinion held that IEEPA's language authorizes the regulation, blocking, and freezing of financial transactions and property interests. It does not extend to the imposition of customs duties on imported goods. The power to levy tariffs, the Court ruled, is a function of trade law and belongs to Congress &mdash; not to the president acting unilaterally under emergency powers.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#9878;</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> Every tariff imposed under IEEPA authority has been declared unconstitutional. This does not affect tariffs imposed under other legal authorities (Section 301, Section 232, or the new Section 122). But the IEEPA-based tariffs &mdash; which covered hundreds of billions of dollars in annual imports &mdash; are legally void. And the duties collected under those void tariffs must be returned to the importers who paid them.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The ruling did not just change the future of trade policy. It reached backward. Every dollar collected under IEEPA tariff authority since the tariffs were first imposed is now subject to refund claims. This is not a theoretical possibility &mdash; it is a legal right. The question is not whether you are owed money. If you paid IEEPA duties, you are. The question is whether you file the right paperwork before the deadlines expire.</p>

                    <h2 id="how-much-at-stake">How Much Money Is at Stake</h2>

                    <p>The scale of the IEEPA tariff refund situation is staggering. Between early 2025 and February 20, 2026, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collected an estimated <strong>$133 billion to $175 billion</strong> in duties that were assessed under IEEPA authority.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout callout-success">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#128200;</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>Key Numbers:</strong> An estimated <strong>$133&ndash;$175 billion</strong> in IEEPA duties were collected from importers since 2025. Every importer of record who paid these duties is entitled to a full refund <strong>plus interest</strong>. Interest accrues from the date of payment to the date of refund.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>To put that in perspective, this is the largest mass refund event in the history of U.S. customs enforcement. It dwarfs previous tariff refund episodes by orders of magnitude. The duties were collected across virtually every product category &mdash; from electronics and auto parts to consumer goods, food products, raw materials, and industrial components.</p>

                    <p>The refund applies to every importer of record who paid duties that were assessed under IEEPA authority. This includes:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Large multinational corporations</strong> that import billions in goods annually</li>
                        <li><strong>Mid-size manufacturers</strong> that import raw materials and components</li>
                        <li><strong>Small businesses and e-commerce sellers</strong> that import finished goods for resale</li>
                        <li><strong>Any company that acted as the importer of record</strong> on entries assessed IEEPA duties</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The refund amount for each importer depends on the volume and value of their IEEPA-duty imports during the period. For a business importing $1 million per month in goods that were subject to a 20% IEEPA tariff, the refund could exceed <strong>$2.4 million plus interest</strong> for the roughly 12-month collection period. For larger importers, the numbers climb into the tens or hundreds of millions.</p>

                    <p>If you paid any of the following tariffs, you are entitled to a refund:</p>

                            <strong>Important Distinction:</strong> Tariffs imposed under <strong>other legal authorities</strong> are <em>not</em> affected by the Supreme Court ruling and are <em>not</em> refundable. This includes Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods, Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, antidumping and countervailing duties, and the new Section 122 global tariff. Only duties specifically assessed under IEEPA authority qualify for refunds.

                    </div>

                    <p>The critical factor is the <strong>legal basis cited on your entry documents</strong>. If the duty was assessed under IEEPA authority, it is refundable. If it was assessed under Section 301, Section 232, or another statute, it is not. Many importers had duties assessed under multiple authorities simultaneously &mdash; in those cases, only the IEEPA portion is refundable.</p>

                    <h2 id="two-paths">Two Paths to Your Refund: PSC vs. Protest</h2>

                    <p>There are two legal mechanisms for recovering overpaid IEEPA duties, and which one you use depends entirely on whether your entries have been <strong>liquidated</strong> by CBP.</p>

                    <p><strong>Liquidation</strong> is the final computation of duties owed on an import entry. CBP typically liquidates entries 314 days after the date of entry, though extensions are common. Until an entry is liquidated, it is considered "open" and can be corrected. Once liquidated, changes must go through the formal protest process.</p>

                    <h3>Path A: Post Summary Correction (PSC)</h3>

                    <p>If your entries have <strong>not yet been liquidated</strong> by CBP, the Post Summary Correction is your faster and simpler route to a refund. A PSC amends the original entry summary to remove the IEEPA-based duty assessment, and the corrected entry then liquidates at the lower (non-IEEPA) rate.</p>

                    <p>The key deadlines for PSC filing are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>300 days from the date of entry</strong>, OR</li>
                        <li><strong>15 days before the scheduled liquidation date</strong> &mdash; whichever comes first</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>PSCs are filed electronically through the ACE system, typically by your customs broker. The correction removes the IEEPA duty line items from the entry summary and recalculates the total duties owed. When CBP liquidates the corrected entry, the overpayment is refunded.</p>

                    <h3>Path B: Administrative Protest (CBP Form 19)</h3>

                    <p>If your entries have <strong>already been liquidated</strong>, you must file a formal Administrative Protest using CBP Form 19. This is a more involved process, but it is the only way to recover duties on entries that CBP has already finalized.</p>

                    <p>The critical deadline is <strong>180 days from the date of liquidation</strong>. Miss this deadline and you permanently forfeit your right to a refund on that entry.</p>

                    <p>The protest must include a detailed legal basis for the claim (the Supreme Court ruling provides this), supporting documentation, and a specific dollar amount being claimed. CBP reviews the protest and issues a decision. If the protest is approved, the refund is issued plus interest. If denied, you can appeal to the U.S. Court of International Trade within 180 days of the denial.</p>

                            <strong>Practical Tip:</strong> Many importers will have a mix of both liquidated and unliquidated entries.

Start by pulling your full entry history and classifying each entry by liquidation status.

                                <p>Pull every entry summary from January 2025 through February 20, 2026. Identify all entries where duties were assessed under IEEPA authority. Look for HTS codes and duty lines that reference IEEPA executive orders, reciprocal tariff proclamations, or the specific country-based IEEPA surcharges. Your customs broker should be able to generate a filtered report from ACE showing IEEPA-specific assessments. Compile the total dollar amount of IEEPA duties paid across all entries.</p>

                                <p>For each IEEPA-duty entry, determine whether it has been liquidated by CBP. You can check liquidation status through ACE, through your customs broker's system, or by reviewing CBP bulletin notices. Entries filed within the last 10&ndash;11 months are more likely to be unliquidated. Entries from early 2025 may already be liquidated. Separate your entries into two lists: one for PSC filing (unliquidated) and one for protest filing (liquidated).</p>

For protests, you will also need a legal brief citing the Supreme Court ruling as the basis for the refund claim. Organize documents by entry number for efficient filing.</p>

                                <p>Work with your customs broker to file Post Summary Corrections through ACE for every unliquidated entry that was assessed IEEPA duties. The PSC amends the entry summary to remove the IEEPA duty line items and recalculates total duties owed. Ensure each PSC is filed before the 300-day deadline or 15 days before scheduled liquidation, whichever is sooner. <strong>Prioritize entries closest to liquidation</strong> &mdash; once an entry liquidates, you lose the PSC option and must file a protest instead.</p>

The protest must be filed within <strong>180 days of the liquidation date</strong>. Include the Supreme Court ruling citation (<em>Learning Resources, Inc. v.

Monitor ACE for PSC processing updates and liquidation notices.

                    <p>This is the largest customs refund event in U.S. history. CBP will be processing an unprecedented volume of corrections and protests simultaneously. Here is what to realistically expect:</p>

                            <p>Post Summary Corrections are processed as part of the normal liquidation cycle. Once the corrected entry liquidates, the duty overpayment is refunded. Under normal conditions this takes a few months, but the surge in PSC filings may extend processing to 6&ndash;9 months. Entries closer to their liquidation date will be processed sooner.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Protest Refunds: 12&ndash;18+ Months</h4>
                            <p>Administrative protests require formal CBP review and a written decision. CBP has two years to decide, and given the volume of IEEPA-related protests, most trade attorneys expect processing to take 12&ndash;18 months at minimum. Complex cases or cases involving large dollar amounts may take longer. Interest continues to accrue during the processing period.</p>

                            <p>Under 19 U.S.C. &sect; 1505(c), interest on duty refunds accrues from the date the duties were deposited with CBP. The interest rate is set quarterly and is based on the federal short-term rate. This means the longer processing takes, the more interest you receive. Interest is not a consolation prize &mdash; on large refund amounts over 12&ndash;18 months, it can add meaningfully to your total recovery.</p>

                            <p>Given the scale and uniformity of these claims (all based on the same Supreme Court ruling), CBP may issue a blanket instruction to liquidate or reliquidate IEEPA entries at zero duty. This would dramatically accelerate the refund process. Trade associations are actively lobbying for this approach. Monitor CBP Federal Register notices and trade publications for updates.</p>

                    <p>The refund process is straightforward in principle but unforgiving in execution. Here are the most common errors that can delay or destroy your refund claim:</p>

                                <h3>Missing Deadlines</h3>
                                <p>This is the single biggest risk. The 180-day protest window and the 300-day PSC window are <strong>hard deadlines</strong> &mdash; once they pass, your right to a refund on that entry is gone permanently. Do not assume CBP will extend deadlines or create special accommodations. Start your audit and filing process immediately. The earliest IEEPA entries from early 2025 may have protest deadlines approaching in the next few months.</p>

                                <h3>Incorrect Entry Classification</h3>
                                <p>Filing a PSC on an entry that has already been liquidated will be rejected. Filing a protest on an entry that has not yet been liquidated is premature and wasteful. You must accurately determine the liquidation status of every entry before choosing your filing method. Check ACE or consult your broker &mdash; do not guess.</p>

Vague or generalized filings that do not tie the claim to specific entry numbers and dollar amounts will be returned for correction &mdash; potentially eating into your deadline window.</p>

                                <h3>Confusing IEEPA Duties with Other Tariffs</h3>
                                <p>Only duties assessed under IEEPA authority are refundable. Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods, Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, antidumping and countervailing duties, and the new Section 122 global tariff are all still valid and <strong>not subject to refund</strong>. If you claim a refund on non-IEEPA duties, your entire filing may be rejected. Verify the legal basis of each duty assessment before including it in your claim.</p>

                                <h3>Waiting for CBP to Act on Its Own</h3>
                                <p>Do not assume CBP will proactively refund overpaid IEEPA duties without a filing from you. While CBP may eventually issue blanket reliquidation guidance, there is no guarantee of when &mdash; or if &mdash; that will happen. The safe approach is to file your claims now. If CBP issues bulk relief later, your individual filings become moot. If they do not, you have protected your rights.</p>

                    <p>Filing IEEPA refund claims requires one thing above all else: <strong>organized, complete import records</strong>. And that is precisely where a well-run 3PL warehouse proves its value beyond day-to-day logistics.</p>

                            <p>Every shipment that arrives at a 3PL warehouse is logged with detailed receiving documentation &mdash; including entry numbers, container numbers, arrival dates, and quantities. These records create a parallel trail that helps you reconcile CBP entry data against physical goods received. When you need to prove that a specific entry was assessed IEEPA duties and that the goods were actually imported, your 3PL's receiving logs provide critical corroboration.</p>

                            <p>Many 3PL operations maintain copies of entry summaries, commercial invoices, and packing lists as part of their standard receiving process. If your own records are incomplete &mdash; or if your customs broker's archives are difficult to access &mdash; your 3PL's files may contain the documents you need to assemble your refund claim.</p>

                            <h3>How do I get a refund for IEEPA tariffs I already paid?</h3>
                            <p>There are two paths depending on the status of your entries. For <strong>unliquidated entries</strong>, file a Post Summary Correction (PSC) within 300 days of entry or 15 days before scheduled liquidation. For <strong>liquidated entries</strong>, file an Administrative Protest (CBP Form 19) within 180 days of the liquidation date. Both methods require supporting documentation including entry summaries, duty payment receipts, and proof that duties were assessed under IEEPA authority. Work with your customs broker to determine which path applies to each of your entries.</p>

                            <h3>How much money is at stake in IEEPA tariff refunds?</h3>
                            <p>Between <strong>$133 billion and $175 billion</strong> in IEEPA-based duties were collected from importers between early 2025 and February 20, 2026. Every importer of record who paid these duties is entitled to a full refund plus interest. The exact amount each importer can recover depends on the volume and value of their imports during this period. For a business that imported $1 million per month at a 20% IEEPA rate, the refund could exceed $2.4 million plus interest.</p>

                            <p>Deadlines depend on the status of your entries. For unliquidated entries, you must file a Post Summary Correction within <strong>300 days of the entry date</strong> or at least 15 days before the scheduled liquidation date. For liquidated entries, you must file a CBP protest within <strong>180 days of the liquidation date</strong>. Missing these deadlines means permanently forfeiting your right to a refund on that entry. Importers should audit their records and begin filing immediately.</p>

                            <p>A Post Summary Correction (PSC) is used for entries that have <strong>not yet been liquidated</strong> (finalized) by CBP. It is a faster, simpler process that amends the original entry summary. A CBP Administrative Protest (filed on Form 19) is required for entries that have <strong>already been liquidated</strong>. The protest is a formal review process where CBP evaluates your claim and issues a decision. PSCs are generally processed faster (3&ndash;9 months), while protests can take 12&ndash;18 months or longer.</p>

                    <p>El <strong>20 de febrero de 2026</strong>, la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos emiti&oacute; la decisi&oacute;n comercial m&aacute;s trascendental en la historia moderna estadounidense. En un <strong>fallo 6-3</strong> en <em>Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump</em>, la Corte sostuvo que la Ley de Poderes Econ&oacute;micos de Emergencia Internacional (IEEPA) no otorga al presidente la autoridad para imponer aranceles sobre bienes importados.</p>

                    <p>La IEEPA, promulgada en 1977, otorga al presidente amplios poderes para regular transacciones econ&oacute;micas durante emergencias nacionales declaradas. Desde principios de 2025, la administraci&oacute;n Trump hab&iacute;a confiado en IEEPA como la base legal para aranceles amplios sobre importaciones de China, Canad&aacute;, M&eacute;xico y docenas de otros pa&iacute;ses &mdash; citando emergencias nacionales relacionadas con d&eacute;ficits comerciales, tr&aacute;fico de fentanilo e inmigraci&oacute;n.</p>

                    <p>La Corte Suprema no estuvo de acuerdo con esta interpretaci&oacute;n. La opini&oacute;n mayoritaria sostuvo que el lenguaje de IEEPA autoriza la regulaci&oacute;n, bloqueo y congelamiento de transacciones financieras e intereses de propiedad. No se extiende a la imposici&oacute;n de aranceles aduaneros sobre bienes importados. El poder de imponer aranceles, dictamin&oacute; la Corte, es una funci&oacute;n de la ley comercial y pertenece al Congreso &mdash; no al presidente actuando unilateralmente bajo poderes de emergencia.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">

                            <strong>La Conclusi&oacute;n:</strong> Cada arancel impuesto bajo autoridad IEEPA ha sido declarado inconstitucional. Esto no afecta los aranceles impuestos bajo otras autoridades legales (Secci&oacute;n 301, Secci&oacute;n 232 o la nueva Secci&oacute;n 122). Pero los aranceles basados en IEEPA &mdash; que cubrieron cientos de miles de millones de d&oacute;lares en importaciones anuales &mdash; son legalmente nulos. Y los aranceles cobrados bajo esos aranceles nulos deben ser devueltos a los importadores que los pagaron.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>El fallo no solo cambi&oacute; el futuro de la pol&iacute;tica comercial. Se extendi&oacute; hacia atr&aacute;s. Cada d&oacute;lar cobrado bajo autoridad arancelaria IEEPA desde que los aranceles se impusieron por primera vez est&aacute; ahora sujeto a reclamos de reembolso. Esto no es una posibilidad te&oacute;rica &mdash; es un derecho legal. La pregunta no es si le deben dinero. Si pag&oacute; aranceles IEEPA, le deben. La pregunta es si presenta la documentaci&oacute;n correcta antes de que venzan los plazos.</p>

                    <p>La escala de la situaci&oacute;n de reembolso de aranceles IEEPA es asombrosa. Entre principios de 2025 y el 20 de febrero de 2026, Aduanas y Protecci&oacute;n Fronteriza de EE.UU. (CBP) cobr&oacute; un estimado de <strong>$133 mil millones a $175 mil millones</strong> en aranceles que fueron evaluados bajo autoridad IEEPA.</p>

Cada importador de registro que pag&oacute; estos aranceles tiene derecho a un reembolso completo <strong>m&aacute;s intereses</strong>.

Los aranceles fueron cobrados en pr&aacute;cticamente todas las categor&iacute;as de productos &mdash; desde electr&oacute;nica y autopartes hasta bienes de consumo, productos alimenticios, materias primas y componentes industriales.</p>

                    <p>El reembolso aplica a cada importador de registro que pag&oacute; aranceles evaluados bajo autoridad IEEPA. Esto incluye:</p>

                    <ul>

                    <p>El monto del reembolso para cada importador depende del volumen y valor de sus importaciones con aranceles IEEPA durante el per&iacute;odo. Para una empresa que importa $1 mill&oacute;n por mes en bienes sujetos a un arancel IEEPA del 20%, el reembolso podr&iacute;a exceder <strong>$2.4 millones m&aacute;s intereses</strong> por el per&iacute;odo de recaudaci&oacute;n de aproximadamente 12 meses. Para importadores m&aacute;s grandes, las cifras ascienden a decenas o cientos de millones.</p>

                    <p>El factor cr&iacute;tico es la <strong>base legal citada en sus documentos de entrada</strong>. Si el arancel fue evaluado bajo autoridad IEEPA, es reembolsable. Si fue evaluado bajo la Secci&oacute;n 301, Secci&oacute;n 232 u otro estatuto, no lo es.

                    <p>Hay dos mecanismos legales para recuperar aranceles IEEPA pagados en exceso, y cu&aacute;l usar depende enteramente de si sus entradas han sido <strong>liquidadas</strong> por CBP.</p>

                    <p><strong>Liquidaci&oacute;n</strong> es el c&aacute;lculo final de aranceles adeudados en una entrada de importaci&oacute;n. CBP t&iacute;picamente liquida las entradas 314 d&iacute;as despu&eacute;s de la fecha de entrada, aunque las extensiones son comunes. Hasta que una entrada es liquidada, se considera "abierta" y puede corregirse. Una vez liquidada, los cambios deben pasar por el proceso formal de protesta.</p>

                    <h3>Camino A: Correcci&oacute;n Post Resumen (PSC)</h3>

                    <p>Si sus entradas <strong>a&uacute;n no han sido liquidadas</strong> por CBP, la Correcci&oacute;n Post Resumen es su ruta m&aacute;s r&aacute;pida y simple hacia un reembolso. Un PSC enmienda el resumen de entrada original para eliminar la evaluaci&oacute;n arancelaria basada en IEEPA, y la entrada corregida se liquida a la tasa inferior (sin IEEPA).</p>

                    <p>Los plazos clave para la presentaci&oacute;n de PSC son:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>300 d&iacute;as desde la fecha de entrada</strong>, O</li>
                        <li><strong>15 d&iacute;as antes de la fecha de liquidaci&oacute;n programada</strong> &mdash; lo que ocurra primero</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Los PSC se presentan electr&oacute;nicamente a trav&eacute;s del sistema ACE, t&iacute;picamente por su agente aduanal. La correcci&oacute;n elimina las l&iacute;neas de aranceles IEEPA del resumen de entrada y recalcula los aranceles totales adeudados. Cuando CBP liquida la entrada corregida, el sobrepago se reembolsa.</p>

                    <h3>Camino B: Protesta Administrativa (CBP Form 19)</h3>

                    <p>Si sus entradas <strong>ya han sido liquidadas</strong>, debe presentar una Protesta Administrativa formal usando el CBP Form 19. Este es un proceso m&aacute;s complejo, pero es la &uacute;nica forma de recuperar aranceles en entradas que CBP ya ha finalizado.</p>

                    <p>El plazo cr&iacute;tico es <strong>180 d&iacute;as desde la fecha de liquidaci&oacute;n</strong>. Si pierde este plazo, pierde permanentemente su derecho a reembolso en esa entrada.</p>

                    <p>La protesta debe incluir una base legal detallada para el reclamo (el fallo de la Corte Suprema proporciona esto), documentaci&oacute;n de respaldo y un monto espec&iacute;fico en d&oacute;lares reclamado. CBP revisa la protesta y emite una decisi&oacute;n. Si la protesta es aprobada, el reembolso se emite m&aacute;s intereses. Si es denegada, puede apelar ante la Corte de Comercio Internacional de EE.UU. dentro de 180 d&iacute;as de la denegaci&oacute;n.</p>

                    <p>Este es el evento de reembolso aduanero m&aacute;s grande en la historia de EE.UU. CBP estar&aacute; procesando un volumen sin precedentes de correcciones y protestas simult&aacute;neamente. Esto es lo que puede esperar de manera realista:</p>

                            <p>Las Correcciones Post Resumen se procesan como parte del ciclo normal de liquidaci&oacute;n. Una vez que la entrada corregida se liquida, el sobrepago de aranceles se reembolsa. En condiciones normales esto toma unos meses, pero la avalancha de presentaciones de PSC puede extender el procesamiento a 6&ndash;9 meses. Las entradas m&aacute;s cercanas a su fecha de liquidaci&oacute;n se procesar&aacute;n antes.</p>

                            <p>Las protestas administrativas requieren revisi&oacute;n formal de CBP y una decisi&oacute;n escrita. CBP tiene dos a&ntilde;os para decidir, y dado el volumen de protestas relacionadas con IEEPA, la mayor&iacute;a de los abogados de comercio esperan que el procesamiento tome 12&ndash;18 meses como m&iacute;nimo. Los casos complejos o casos que involucran grandes montos en d&oacute;lares pueden tomar m&aacute;s tiempo. Los intereses contin&uacute;an acumul&aacute;ndose durante el per&iacute;odo de procesamiento.</p>

                            <p>Bajo 19 U.S.C. &sect; 1505(c), los intereses sobre reembolsos de aranceles se acumulan desde la fecha en que los aranceles fueron depositados con CBP. La tasa de inter&eacute;s se establece trimestralmente y se basa en la tasa federal a corto plazo. Esto significa que cuanto m&aacute;s tarde el procesamiento, m&aacute;s intereses recibe. Los intereses no son un premio de consolaci&oacute;n &mdash; en montos grandes de reembolso durante 12&ndash;18 meses, pueden a&ntilde;adir significativamente a su recuperaci&oacute;n total.</p>

                                <p>Este es el mayor riesgo. La ventana de protesta de 180 d&iacute;as y la ventana de PSC de 300 d&iacute;as son <strong>plazos inamovibles</strong> &mdash; una vez que pasan, su derecho a reembolso en esa entrada desaparece permanentemente. No asuma que CBP extender&aacute; plazos o crear&aacute; acomodaciones especiales. Comience su proceso de auditor&iacute;a y presentaci&oacute;n inmediatamente. Las entradas IEEPA m&aacute;s antiguas de principios de 2025 pueden tener plazos de protesta que se acercan en los pr&oacute;ximos meses.</p>

El monto exacto que cada importador puede recuperar depende del volumen y valor de sus importaciones durante este per&iacute;odo. Para una empresa que import&oacute; $1 mill&oacute;n por mes a una tasa IEEPA del 20%, el reembolso podr&iacute;a exceder $2.4 millones m&aacute;s intereses.</p>

Para entradas no liquidadas, debe presentar una Correcci&oacute;n Post Resumen dentro de <strong>300 d&iacute;as de la fecha de entrada</strong> o al menos 15 d&iacute;as antes de la fecha de liquidaci&oacute;n programada.
