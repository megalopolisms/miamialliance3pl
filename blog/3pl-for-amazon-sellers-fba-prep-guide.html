This includes FNSKU labeling, poly bagging, bubble wrapping fragile items, bundling and kitting multi-packs, creating box content labels, and palletizing shipments. Amazon rejects shipments that don't comply with their prep guidelines, resulting in delays, extra fees, and potential account penalties. A 3PL with FBA prep services handles all of this for you, ensuring every unit meets Amazon's standards before it ships to the fulfillment center."

                    "text": "FBA prep costs at a third-party logistics provider typically range from $0.50 to $3.00 per unit depending on the services required. Basic FNSKU labeling runs $0.20 to $0.50 per unit. Poly bagging costs $0.30 to $0.75 per unit. Bubble wrapping is $0.50 to $1.50 per unit. Bundling and kitting ranges from $1.00 to $3.00 per bundle. Box content labels are usually $2.00 to $5.00 per box. For an Amazon seller shipping 1,000 units per month that need labeling and poly bagging, total FBA prep costs would be approximately $500 to $1,250 per month at a 3PL. This is significantly less than Amazon's own FBA prep fees, which run $1.00 to $2.20 per unit."

FBA is ideal for small, lightweight, fast-moving products where the Prime badge drives conversions and Amazon's fulfillment network provides faster delivery than you could achieve independently. FBM is better for oversized or heavy items where FBA fees are prohibitive, slow-moving products that would accumulate long-term storage fees at Amazon, custom or made-to-order products, and items with thin margins that can't absorb FBA's fulfillment and referral fees. Many successful Amazon sellers use a hybrid strategy — FBA for their top 20% of SKUs that drive 80% of revenue, and FBM for the long tail of slower-moving or specialty products."

For FBA, the 3PL receives your inventory, preps it to Amazon's specifications (labeling, poly bagging, bundling), and ships compliant pallets directly to Amazon's fulfillment centers. For FBM, the 3PL stores your inventory and fulfills individual customer orders as they come in from Amazon, shipping directly to the end customer with tracking pushed back to Seller Central. Running both from one warehouse means one inventory pool, one receiving process, and one logistics partner — instead of managing separate operations for each channel."

Miami Alliance 3PL is located at 8780 NW 100th ST, Medley, FL 33178, in the heart of Miami's logistics district, and offers full FBA prep services with 99.8% accuracy and same-day processing for orders received by 2 PM."

                    <p class="article-lead">You built a profitable Amazon business from your garage. The products sell. The reviews are strong. The revenue is growing. But somewhere between stickering 600 units with FNSKU labels at 11 PM, Googling "Amazon poly bag suffocation warning requirements" for the third time this month, and discovering that Amazon rejected your last inbound shipment because your box content labels were formatted wrong, you realize something critical: <strong>Amazon's fulfillment requirements are a full-time job, and you already have one.</strong> Whether you're sending inventory to Amazon's FBA warehouses or fulfilling orders yourself through FBM, the logistics behind a growing Amazon business are complex, unforgiving, and increasingly expensive to handle alone. One prep mistake means a rejected shipment. One late FBM order means a performance metric hit. One inventory planning error during Q4 means running out of stock on your best-selling product at the worst possible time. This guide breaks down everything an Amazon seller needs to know about working with a <strong>3PL for Amazon</strong> operations — from FBA prep services to FBM fulfillment to the hybrid strategy that the most successful sellers are using in 2026.</p>

                    <h2 id="fba-vs-fbm">FBA vs. FBM: Understanding Your Options</h2>

                    <p>Every Amazon seller faces a fundamental decision: let Amazon handle fulfillment (FBA) or do it yourself (FBM). Each model has distinct advantages, costs, and operational requirements. The choice is not binary — most serious sellers use both — but understanding the differences is essential before you decide how a <strong>3PL for Amazon sellers</strong> fits into your operation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)</strong> means you ship your inventory to Amazon's warehouses. When a customer orders your product, Amazon picks, packs, and ships it. Amazon handles customer service and returns for FBA orders. Your products earn the Prime badge, which significantly increases conversion rates. The trade-off: you pay FBA fulfillment fees, storage fees, and you must comply with Amazon's strict prep and labeling requirements before your inventory even enters their warehouse.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fulfillment by Merchant (FBM)</strong> means you store inventory in your own warehouse (or a 3PL's warehouse) and ship directly to customers when orders come in. You control packaging, shipping speed, carrier selection, and the customer experience. FBM products do not automatically qualify for Prime (though Seller Fulfilled Prime exists for qualified sellers). The trade-off: you handle all fulfillment logistics, customer service, and returns — and your performance metrics must meet Amazon's strict standards or risk account suspension.</p>

                    <p>Here is a direct comparison of the two models for a typical Amazon seller:</p>

                    <p>Neither model is universally better. The right choice depends on your product catalog, margins, sales velocity, and business strategy. What matters is understanding that a <strong>3PL for Amazon sellers</strong> can handle the heavy lifting for both models — FBA prep for inbound shipments and FBM fulfillment for direct-to-customer orders — from a single warehouse.</p>

                    <h2 id="fba-prep-explained">What Is FBA Prep? Every Service Explained</h2>

                    <p>Amazon's <strong>FBA prep requirements</strong> are among the most detailed in e-commerce. Every unit entering an Amazon fulfillment center must meet specific labeling, packaging, and shipping standards. Fail to comply, and Amazon will reject your shipment, charge you a non-compliance fee, or worse — dispose of your inventory. Here is every FBA prep service that a <strong>3PL Amazon prep center</strong> handles for you, step by step:</p>

                                <h3>FNSKU Labeling</h3>
                                <p>Every unit sold through FBA must carry an Amazon FNSKU (Fulfillment Network Stock Keeping Unit) barcode label. The FNSKU is a unique identifier that ties the specific product to your seller account — it is different from the manufacturer's UPC barcode. When Amazon warehouse workers scan the FNSKU, they know exactly which seller's inventory they are handling. Your 3PL prints FNSKU labels from your Seller Central account, applies them to each unit (covering any existing barcodes to prevent scanning errors), and verifies that every label is scannable. A single unscannable label means that unit goes into Amazon's problem queue, delaying your entire shipment. Professional <strong>FBA prep services</strong> use thermal printers and standardized label placement to ensure 100% scan rates.</p>

                                <p>Amazon requires poly bagging for products that could be damaged by dust, moisture, or accidental opening during warehouse handling — including textiles, plush items, products with loose parts, and anything in packaging that is not sealed. The poly bag must be transparent, sealed with a self-adhesive strip or heat-sealed, and must include a suffocation warning if the bag opening is larger than 5 inches. Your 3PL selects the correct bag size for each product, inserts the item, seals the bag, ensures the suffocation warning is printed on or attached to the bag, and applies the FNSKU label to the outside of the poly bag (not to the product inside it). Incorrect poly bagging — wrong size, missing suffocation warning, label under the bag instead of on it — is one of the top reasons Amazon rejects inbound shipments.</p>

                                <p>Fragile items — glass bottles, ceramics, electronics, anything that could crack or shatter during Amazon's warehouse handling — require bubble wrap protection. Amazon specifies that bubble wrap must completely cover the product with at least one full layer, the wrap must be secured with tape (not just folded), and the FNSKU label must be scannable through or placed on the outside of the bubble wrap. Your 3PL wraps each fragile unit individually, secures the wrap with clear tape, and positions the FNSKU label on a flat, scannable surface. For items with irregular shapes, the prep team may use additional dunnage or custom wrapping techniques to ensure the item survives the conveyor belts, chutes, and stacking inside Amazon's fulfillment centers.</p>

Amazon requires that bundled items be enclosed together in a single package (shrink-wrapped, poly-bagged, or boxed) with a single FNSKU label identifying the bundle. The bundle cannot be easily opened or separated without damaging the packaging. Your 3PL assembles the bundle according to your product listing, packages the components together, applies the bundle's unique FNSKU (different from the individual product FNSKUs), and ensures the bundle matches your Amazon listing photos and description exactly. Mismatched bundles — wrong items included, wrong quantity, wrong FNSKU — result in customer complaints, A-to-Z claims, and listing suspensions.</p>

                                <p>When you ship cartons of inventory to Amazon FBA, each box must include a box content label (also called an FBA shipment label or carton ID label). This label tells the Amazon receiving team exactly what is inside the box — the SKUs, quantities, and which shipment the box belongs to. Box content labels are generated in Seller Central when you create an inbound shipment plan. Your 3PL prints these labels, applies one to each carton, and verifies that the contents of every box match the label exactly. If Box A's label says "24 units of FNSKU X1234" but the box actually contains 22 units, Amazon flags a discrepancy. Repeated discrepancies degrade your seller metrics and can result in Amazon requiring you to use their paid FBA Label Service instead — at $0.55 per unit. Getting box content labels right the first time saves money and protects your account health.</p>

                                <p>For larger shipments, Amazon requires palletized delivery — your cartons stacked neatly on standard 40" x 48" GMA pallets, stretch-wrapped securely, and shipped via LTL (less-than-truckload) or FTL (full truckload) freight. Amazon specifies maximum pallet height (72 inches including the pallet), weight limits (1,500 lbs per pallet), stacking requirements (heaviest boxes on bottom, no overhang), and four-way stretch wrap with corner boards for stability. Your 3PL builds compliant pallets, applies pallet labels from your inbound shipment plan, arranges freight pickup with Amazon-partnered carriers or your preferred LTL carrier, and provides BOL (bill of lading) documentation. A properly palletized shipment gets checked in at Amazon faster, reducing the time your inventory sits in "Receiving" status and accelerating your products' availability for sale.</p>

                            <strong>Compliance Reality:</strong> According to Amazon seller forums and industry data, approximately 15-20% of FBA inbound shipments from sellers who self-prep are rejected or flagged for non-compliance on the first attempt. Each rejection costs 2-4 weeks of delay while you fix the issues and reship. For sellers using a professional <strong>FBA prep 3PL</strong>, the rejection rate drops below 1%. The math is straightforward: a rejected shipment during peak season can cost you thousands in lost sales. A prep center that does it right the first time pays for itself.

                    <h2 id="fbm-when-better">FBM (Merchant Fulfilled): When It Makes More Sense</h2>

                    <p>FBA gets most of the attention, but <strong>Amazon FBM fulfillment</strong> is the smarter choice for a surprising number of product categories and business situations. Here are the scenarios where fulfilling orders yourself (or through a 3PL) instead of using Amazon's warehouses makes more financial and operational sense:</p>

                    <p><strong>Oversized and heavy items.</strong> Amazon's FBA fees are calculated by dimensional weight and product size tier. A 30-pound bag of dog food, a 48-inch standing desk, or a set of cast-iron cookware gets classified into Amazon's "Large Oversize" or "Special Oversize" tier, where fulfillment fees can reach $40-$150+ per unit. At those fee levels, FBA erases your margin entirely. Fulfilling oversize items from a 3PL using standard freight carriers costs a fraction of FBA's oversize fees — and you control which carrier delivers, what the packaging looks like, and how quickly it ships.</p>

                    <p><strong>Slow-moving inventory.</strong> Amazon charges monthly storage fees on every cubic foot of space your inventory occupies in their warehouses. For fast-selling products, storage fees are negligible because units turn over quickly. But for slow-moving products — seasonal items, niche products, long-tail SKUs — storage fees accumulate month after month. After 271 days, Amazon hits you with aged inventory surcharges of $6.90 per cubic foot. After 365 days, the surcharge increases dramatically. If a product sells 10 units per month but you shipped 500 units to FBA, you are paying storage penalties on 490 units that are sitting idle. At a 3PL, pallet storage costs $15-$40 per month regardless of how long the inventory sits — no aging penalties, no surcharges.</p>

                    <p><strong>Custom, personalized, or made-to-order products.</strong> FBA requires you to ship pre-made inventory to Amazon's warehouse before any customer orders it. If your product involves customization — engraved jewelry, custom-printed phone cases, personalized nutrition labels — you cannot pre-make every possible variant. FBM allows you to produce the item after the order comes in and ship it directly. A 3PL with kitting and assembly capabilities can handle custom orders by maintaining component inventory and assembling on demand.</p>

                    <p><strong>Products with thin margins.</strong> Some products sell at price points where FBA's combined fulfillment fee, referral fee, and storage fee consume the entire margin. A product that retails for $12.99 on Amazon with a $5 landed cost faces roughly $4.75 in FBA fulfillment fees plus a $1.95 referral fee — leaving you with $1.29 before advertising, returns, and storage. Fulfilling through FBM with a 3PL may cost $2.50-$4.00 per order including shipping, preserving significantly more margin on low-priced items.</p>

                    <p><strong>Multi-channel sellers who want one inventory pool.</strong> If you sell on Amazon, Shopify, Walmart, and Etsy, sending all your inventory to FBA means only Amazon orders get fulfilled. Your other channels need a separate inventory source. FBM with a 3PL lets you store one pool of inventory and fulfill orders from every channel — Amazon, Shopify, WooCommerce, wholesale — from the same warehouse. No split inventory. No duplicate storage costs. No stockouts on one channel while another has surplus.</p>

                            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> FBM is not a lesser strategy than FBA. It is a different strategy. The most profitable Amazon businesses in 2026 use FBM intentionally — not as a fallback, but as a deliberate choice for products and situations where FBA's economics don't work. A <strong>3PL for Amazon sellers</strong> makes FBM operationally feasible because the 3PL handles the picking, packing, shipping, and returns processing that would otherwise fall entirely on you.

                    <h2 id="hybrid-strategy">The Hybrid Strategy: Using Both FBA and FBM</h2>

                    <p>The most successful Amazon sellers in 2026 do not choose between FBA and FBM. They use both — strategically, from the same inventory stored at a single 3PL. This is the hybrid fulfillment model, and it gives you the best of both worlds while mitigating the weaknesses of each approach.</p>

                    <p><strong>How the hybrid strategy works:</strong> You send your inventory to a 3PL warehouse. The 3PL maintains your entire product catalog in one location. Based on your strategy, the 3PL handles two parallel workflows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>FBA replenishment:</strong> For your top-selling, Prime-eligible SKUs, the 3PL preps inventory (FNSKU labels, poly bags, box content labels) and ships regular replenishment batches to Amazon's fulfillment centers. You maintain 2-4 weeks of FBA inventory at Amazon, while the bulk of your stock stays at the 3PL at lower storage rates. This minimizes Amazon storage fees and aged inventory surcharges while keeping your best products Prime-eligible.</li>
                        <li><strong>FBM fulfillment:</strong> For your remaining SKUs — oversized items, slow movers, custom products, new launches you're testing — the 3PL fulfills orders directly to customers as they come in from Amazon. The 3PL picks, packs, and ships each order with tracking pushed back to Seller Central. You maintain FBM listings alongside your FBA listings, giving customers options and giving you flexibility.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>The hybrid strategy solves specific problems:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>FBA restock limits.</strong> Amazon caps how many units you can send to FBA at any time. During Q4, these limits tighten right when you need the most inventory. A hybrid seller keeps overflow stock at the 3PL and fulfills via FBM when FBA runs out — instead of going out of stock entirely.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storage cost optimization.</strong> Amazon's storage fees spike dramatically during Q4 (October through December) — up to $3.60 per cubic foot per month versus $0.87 in off-peak months. A hybrid seller reduces FBA inventory heading into Q4, shifts more volume to FBM fulfillment from the 3PL (where pallet storage stays $15-$40 per month year-round), and avoids the seasonal surcharge on slow-moving inventory.</li>
                        <li><strong>New product launches.</strong> Launching a new product on FBA requires shipping inventory to Amazon before you know if the product will sell. If it flops, you're stuck with storage fees or expensive removal orders. A hybrid strategy launches new products on FBM first — the 3PL fulfills the first 100-200 orders while you gather data on demand, reviews, and conversion rates. Once the product is proven, you create an FBA shipment with confidence.</li>
                        <li><strong>Risk diversification.</strong> If Amazon's fulfillment centers experience delays (which happens during peak seasons, weather events, or capacity crunches), your FBA orders are stuck. Your FBM listings, fulfilled by the 3PL, keep shipping on schedule. Having both channels active means a disruption in one does not take your entire Amazon business offline.</li>
                    </ul>

                            <strong>Hybrid Strategy Breakdown:</strong> A typical hybrid Amazon seller sends 60-70% of their total units to FBA (focused on their top 20% of SKUs by sales velocity) and fulfills the remaining 30-40% of orders through FBM via a 3PL. This split typically reduces total Amazon fulfillment costs by 20-35% compared to an all-FBA approach, while maintaining Prime eligibility on the products that benefit most from it.

                    <p>Not all 3PLs are created equal for Amazon sellers. Location, infrastructure, and operational capabilities matter enormously when your business depends on getting compliant shipments to Amazon on time and getting FBM orders to customers fast. Here is why an <strong>Amazon warehouse in Miami</strong> — specifically Miami Alliance 3PL's facility in Medley, FL — is a strategic advantage for Amazon sellers:</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">

                            <p>If you import products from overseas — China, Latin America, Europe — your goods arrive at PortMiami or Miami International Airport. Miami Alliance 3PL's warehouse in Medley, FL is 15 minutes from both. Your containers go directly from the port to our warehouse for FBA prep, eliminating the cross-country truck shipment to a distant prep center. Shorter drayage = faster turnaround and lower freight costs. For Amazon sellers importing from Latin America, Miami is the single best logistics hub in the United States.</p>

                            <p>Miami's location on the Southeast coast provides ground shipping coverage to the most densely populated regions of the country. FBM orders shipping from Medley reach Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and the Gulf Coast in 1 day. New York, Chicago, Texas, and the Mid-Atlantic arrive in 2-3 days by ground. For Amazon FBM sellers, this means competitive delivery speeds without paying for expedited shipping — critical for maintaining your on-time delivery metrics and customer satisfaction ratings.</p>

                            <p>Every order received by 2:00 PM EST ships the same business day. Every FBA prep batch received by morning ships to Amazon the same day. Our 99.8% order accuracy rate means your FBA shipments arrive at Amazon compliant the first time, and your FBM customers receive the right product every time. Late processing and prep errors are the two biggest risks an Amazon seller faces with a 3PL — we have built our operation specifically to eliminate both.</p>

No minimum order commitments. No minimum pallet requirements. No long-term contracts. You pay for what you use — per unit for FBA prep, per order for FBM fulfillment, per pallet for storage. If you have a slow month, your bill is lower. If Q4 doubles your volume, we scale with you. No penalties either way.</p>

                    <p>One of the most common questions Amazon sellers ask when evaluating an <strong>FBA prep 3PL</strong> is: what will this actually cost? Here is a transparent breakdown of typical FBA prep pricing in 2026, comparing self-prep, Amazon's own prep service, and outsourcing to a third-party prep center:</p>

                    <p><strong>The hidden cost of self-prep is your time.</strong> If you spend 20 hours prepping 1,000 units and your time is worth $50/hour as a business owner, self-prep costs $1,000 in opportunity cost alone — plus $150 in materials. A 3PL handles the same 1,000 units for $500-$1,250, frees those 20 hours for sourcing new products, optimizing listings, running PPC campaigns, and scaling your business. The sellers who grow fastest are the ones who stop doing $15-per-hour prep work and invest that time in $200-per-hour strategic activities.</p>

                            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When comparing <strong>FBA prep services in Miami</strong>, ask for all-inclusive per-unit pricing that bundles labeling, poly bagging, and inspection into a single rate. Some prep centers quote a low per-label price but charge separately for inspection, receiving, quality checks, and problem resolution. At Miami Alliance 3PL, our FBA prep pricing includes receiving inspection, FNSKU labeling, prep services, box content labels, and palletizing — one transparent rate per unit with no hidden add-ons.

                    <p>Amazon's inbound shipment requirements are detailed, specific, and unforgiving. Here are the most common FBA prep mistakes that cause shipments to be rejected, delayed, or flagged — and how a professional <strong>Amazon prep center</strong> prevents every one of them:</p>

                            <strong>Mistake #1: FNSKU Labels Covering Important Product Information.</strong> Amazon requires FNSKU labels on every unit, but the label cannot cover safety information, product expiration dates, or legally required consumer warnings. Sellers who slap FNSKU stickers over expiration dates or ingredient lists get compliance violations. A professional prep center trains its team on label placement rules — FNSKU goes on a flat, scannable surface that does not obstruct required product information. This seems obvious until you are labeling 500 units at midnight and accidentally cover the lot number on every single one.

                            <strong>Mistake #2: Wrong Poly Bag Size or Missing Suffocation Warning.</strong> The poly bag must fit the product — not too tight (the bag shouldn't stretch or strain), not too loose (excess plastic creates scanning and handling issues). More critically, any poly bag with an opening of 5 inches or more must have a printed suffocation warning. Sellers who use generic bags from Amazon without checking the suffocation warning requirement get shipments rejected. Some buy bags with suffocation warnings printed in English only, not realizing Amazon requires the warning to be readable and may require multi-language warnings for certain markets.

                            <strong>Mistake #3: Box Content Label Mismatch.</strong> The number and type of units inside each carton must exactly match the box content label generated from your Seller Central shipment plan. If you planned Box 1 to contain 24 units of SKU-A but accidentally packed 22 units of SKU-A and 2 units of SKU-B, Amazon flags a discrepancy during receiving. Repeated discrepancies result in Amazon downgrading your inbound privileges and requiring you to use their paid label service. A 3PL with a barcode-scanning WMS verifies every unit against the shipment plan before sealing each carton — eliminating human counting errors entirely.

                            <strong>Mistake #4: Pallet Dimensions Exceeding Amazon's Limits.</strong> Amazon specifies 40" x 48" GMA pallets, maximum 72 inches tall (including the pallet), maximum 1,500 lbs, with stretch wrap and corner boards. Sellers who stack a pallet to 74 inches or use a non-standard pallet size get turned away at the dock. Even 1 inch of overhang past the pallet edge can cause rejection. A 3PL that regularly ships to Amazon FBA has the correct pallets in stock, calibrated scales for weight verification, and height-measuring tools to ensure every pallet meets spec before it leaves the warehouse.

                            <strong>Mistake #5: Expired Products or Condition Issues Not Caught Before Inbound.</strong> Amazon checks incoming inventory for damage, expiration, and condition. If you send units with dented packaging, peeling labels, or products approaching their expiration date (Amazon requires at least 90 days of remaining shelf life), those units get rejected and you pay removal fees to get them back. A quality-focused <strong>FBA prep 3PL</strong> inspects every unit during receiving — checking for damage, verifying expiration dates, and flagging any units that would fail Amazon's condition standards. The $0.10 inspection cost per unit saves you the $0.50-$1.00 removal fee and the weeks of delay when Amazon quarantines your shipment.

                            <h3>What is FBA prep and why do Amazon sellers need it?</h3>
                            <p>FBA prep is the process of preparing your products to meet Amazon's strict Fulfillment by Amazon requirements before they arrive at an Amazon warehouse. This includes <strong>FNSKU labeling</strong>, poly bagging, bubble wrapping fragile items, bundling and kitting multi-packs, creating box content labels, and palletizing shipments. Amazon rejects shipments that don't comply with their prep guidelines, resulting in delays, extra fees, and potential account penalties. A 3PL with <strong>FBA prep services</strong> handles all of this for you, ensuring every unit meets Amazon's standards before it ships to the fulfillment center.</p>

                            <h3>How much does FBA prep cost at a 3PL?</h3>
                            <p>FBA prep costs at a third-party logistics provider typically range from <strong>$0.50 to $3.00 per unit</strong> depending on the services required. Basic FNSKU labeling runs $0.20 to $0.50 per unit. Poly bagging costs $0.30 to $0.75 per unit. Bubble wrapping is $0.50 to $1.50 per unit. Bundling and kitting ranges from $1.00 to $3.00 per bundle. For an Amazon seller shipping 1,000 units per month that need labeling and poly bagging, total FBA prep costs would be approximately <strong>$500 to $1,250 per month</strong> at a 3PL. This is significantly less than Amazon's own FBA prep fees, which run $1.00 to $2.20 per unit.</p>

                            <h3>Should I use FBA or FBM for my Amazon business?</h3>
                            <p>The best choice depends on your product type, margins, and business model. <strong>FBA</strong> is ideal for small, lightweight, fast-moving products where the Prime badge drives conversions. <strong>FBM</strong> is better for oversized or heavy items where FBA fees are prohibitive, slow-moving products that would accumulate storage fees, custom or made-to-order products, and items with thin margins. Many successful Amazon sellers use a <strong>hybrid strategy</strong> — FBA for their top 20% of SKUs that drive 80% of revenue, and FBM for the long tail of slower-moving or specialty products.</p>

                            <p>Yes. A full-service 3PL like Miami Alliance 3PL handles <strong>both FBA prep and FBM fulfillment</strong> from the same warehouse. For FBA, the 3PL receives your inventory, preps it to Amazon's specifications, and ships compliant pallets to Amazon's fulfillment centers. For FBM, the 3PL stores your inventory and fulfills individual customer orders as they come in from Amazon, shipping directly to the end customer with tracking pushed back to Seller Central. Running both from one warehouse means <strong>one inventory pool</strong>, one receiving process, and one logistics partner.</p>
