                    <p class="article-lead">On February 24, 2026, the new 15% global import tariff under Section 122 took effect &mdash; but not every product is subject to it. The presidential proclamation includes a detailed Annex listing hundreds of Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) codes that are excluded from the duty. Over 90% of these exemptions mirror the exclusions that existed under the previous reciprocal tariff program. This guide breaks down every exempt category so you know exactly what you are paying &mdash; and what you are not.</p>

                    <h2 id="exemption-framework">Understanding the Section 122 Exemption Framework</h2>

                    <p>When the administration invoked Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 on February 22, 2026, the accompanying proclamation did not simply impose a blanket 15% duty on all imports. It included a <strong>detailed Annex of HTS codes</strong> that are explicitly excluded from the new tariff. This Annex is the exemption list &mdash; and understanding it is critical for every importer doing business in the United States.</p>

                    <p>Over <strong>90% of the Section 122 exemptions mirror the exclusions</strong> that previously existed under the reciprocal tariff program. This is not a coincidence. The administration carried forward the same policy logic: products that are critical to U.S. manufacturing, national security, healthcare infrastructure, and food supply should not be burdened with additional import duties that would ultimately raise costs for American businesses and consumers.</p>

                    <p>The exemption framework covers seven major categories: agriculture and food products, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, semiconductors and electronic components, copper and copper products, critical minerals, lumber and forestry products, and energy products. Within each category, the exemptions are defined at the <strong>HTS code level</strong> &mdash; meaning that not every product within a broad category automatically qualifies. A fresh apple and a packaged apple pie may both be "agriculture," but only one is likely exempt.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">
                        <div class="callout-icon">&#9888;</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <strong>Critical Warning:</strong> Being in an "exempt category" does not automatically mean your specific product qualifies. The exemptions are defined by precise HTS codes listed in the Section 122 Annex. You must verify your exact 10-digit HTS classification against the Annex. Claiming an exemption for a non-qualifying product can result in penalties, retroactive duty assessments, and CBP audits.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The rationale behind each exemption category follows a consistent theme: the United States depends on these imports for essential functions, and taxing them would cause more harm to the domestic economy than the tariff revenue would offset. Pharmaceuticals keep hospitals stocked. Semiconductors keep factories running. Energy products keep the lights on. The exemptions are not favors &mdash; they are economic necessities.</p>

                    <p>The following table provides a high-level overview of every major exemption category under the Section 122 Annex. Detailed breakdowns of each category follow in the sections below.</p>

                    <h2 id="agriculture">Agriculture &amp; Food Products</h2>

                    <p>The agricultural exemptions under Section 122 are designed to protect the U.S. food supply chain from cost shocks that would ultimately be passed on to consumers. The United States imports approximately <strong>$200 billion in agricultural products annually</strong>, and many of these imports fill gaps that domestic production cannot cover &mdash; tropical fruits, off-season produce, specialty grains, and raw commodities that serve as inputs for American food manufacturers.</p>

                    <p>The exempt products in this category are concentrated in <strong>raw and minimally processed agricultural commodities</strong>. Fresh fruits and vegetables, unprocessed grains and cereals, live animals for breeding stock, raw sugar, coffee beans, cocoa beans, and certain oilseeds are among the products listed in the Annex. These are the building blocks of the American food system &mdash; products that cannot be easily substituted with domestic alternatives in the short term.</p>

                    <p>However, the exemption does not extend broadly to processed foods, packaged consumer goods, or value-added agricultural products. If your product has undergone significant manufacturing or processing &mdash; canned goods, frozen meals, packaged snacks, bottled beverages &mdash; it is unlikely to qualify. The line between "raw commodity" and "processed product" can be ambiguous, so importers in the food sector should work closely with their customs broker to confirm their specific HTS classification against the Annex. Products in HTS Chapters 1 through 24 are the most likely to contain exemptions, but the coverage is selective, not blanket.</p>

                    <h2 id="pharmaceuticals">Pharmaceuticals &amp; Medical Devices</h2>

                    <p>The pharmaceutical and medical device exemptions represent one of the most significant carve-outs in the Section 122 tariff. The United States imports a substantial share of its pharmaceutical supply chain &mdash; <strong>over 80% of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)</strong> used in American-manufactured drugs come from overseas, primarily from India and China. Taxing these inputs would directly increase the cost of prescription medications, hospital supplies, and medical treatments.</p>

                    <p>The Annex exempts a broad range of pharmaceutical products: <strong>active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), finished pharmaceutical drugs (both branded and generic), biologics, vaccines, diagnostic reagents, and FDA-regulated medical devices</strong>. This includes Class I, II, and III medical devices &mdash; everything from surgical instruments and implantable devices to imaging equipment and diagnostic machines. The exemption also covers certain pharmaceutical intermediates and bulk drug substances used in domestic manufacturing.</p>

                    <p>What is not covered: cosmetics, dietary supplements, wellness products, veterinary products (with some exceptions), and non-FDA-regulated health products. The distinction is regulatory classification &mdash; if the FDA regulates your product as a drug or medical device, it is likely exempt. If it falls under cosmetic, supplement, or consumer product classifications, it is not. Importers should reference their product's FDA classification alongside the HTS code to determine eligibility. Products classified under HTS Chapters 29 (organic chemicals, including APIs) and 30 (pharmaceutical products) are primary candidates, along with medical devices in Chapter 90.</p>

                    <h2 id="semiconductors">Semiconductors &amp; Electronic Components</h2>

                    <p>The semiconductor exemption is a direct extension of the CHIPS and Science Act strategy. The United States has invested over <strong>$52 billion in domestic semiconductor manufacturing</strong> through the CHIPS Act, and taxing the components and equipment needed to build and operate chip fabrication facilities would undermine that investment. The exemption ensures that the tariff does not create a cost barrier to the very industrial policy the government is pursuing.</p>

                    <p>Exempt products include <strong>semiconductor wafers (both processed and unprocessed), integrated circuits, microprocessors, memory chips, logic chips, power semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, photolithography tools, etching and deposition machines, and chip packaging and testing equipment</strong>. The coverage extends through the semiconductor supply chain &mdash; from raw silicon wafers to the specialized machinery used in fabrication. This is critical because most advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment comes from the Netherlands (ASML), Japan (Tokyo Electron), and the United States itself, and the supply chain is deeply global.</p>

                    <p>The exemption does <strong>not</strong> extend to finished consumer electronics that contain semiconductors. A semiconductor wafer is exempt; a finished laptop or smartphone is not. The distinction is between the component and the end product. Importers of electronic components should verify their products at the 10-digit HTS level, as the coverage is specific. Products classified under HTS headings 8541 (semiconductor devices) and 8542 (electronic integrated circuits) are the core exempt categories, along with specific manufacturing equipment codes in Chapter 84.</p>

                    <h2 id="copper">Copper &amp; Critical Minerals</h2>

                    <p>Copper occupies a unique position in the U.S. industrial economy. It is essential to <strong>electrical wiring, construction, electronics, electric vehicle manufacturing, renewable energy systems, and telecommunications infrastructure</strong>. The United States is a net importer of copper, and domestic mining and refining capacity cannot meet current demand &mdash; let alone the surging demand driven by electrification and green energy buildout.</p>

                    <p>The Section 122 Annex exempts <strong>refined copper cathodes, copper alloys (including brass and bronze), copper wire and cable, copper tubes and pipes, copper foil, and copper scrap</strong>. The inclusion of copper scrap is notable &mdash; the U.S. is both an importer and exporter of copper scrap, and the recycling supply chain depends on tariff-free movement of this material. Products classified under HTS Chapter 74 (copper and articles thereof) form the core of this exemption.</p>

                    <p>The critical minerals exemption extends beyond copper to include <strong>rare earth elements, lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, manganese, vanadium, and other minerals</strong> deemed essential to national security and the electric vehicle supply chain. The United States currently imports over 80% of its critical mineral needs, primarily from China, Australia, Chile, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The exemption list for critical minerals aligns closely with the Department of Energy's critical minerals strategy and may expand as additional minerals are added to the federal critical minerals list. Products in HTS Chapters 26 (ores), 28 (inorganic chemicals), and 81 (other base metals) are the primary categories to check.</p>

                    <h2 id="lumber">Lumber &amp; Forestry Products</h2>

                    <p>The lumber and forestry exemption is driven by housing policy. The United States faces a <strong>housing shortage estimated at 4 to 7 million units</strong>, and lumber is the single largest material input in residential construction. Imposing a 15% tariff on imported lumber would directly increase the cost of new home construction at a time when affordability is already at crisis levels.</p>

                    <p>Exempt products include <strong>softwood lumber (the primary structural wood used in home construction), plywood, oriented strand board (OSB), certain hardwood products, raw timber, wood chips, and pulpwood</strong>. These are the core materials that flow into the homebuilding and renovation supply chain. The Annex targets the products that builders and contractors purchase in volume &mdash; the framing lumber, sheathing, and structural panels that form the skeleton of American homes.</p>

                    <p>An important nuance: <strong>Canadian lumber is exempt from the Section 122 tariff, but it remains subject to separate softwood lumber duties</strong> that have been in place for years under antidumping and countervailing duty orders. The Section 122 exemption does not override those existing trade remedy duties. Canadian lumber importers should not assume that the exemption eliminates all tariff costs &mdash; only the new 15% Section 122 layer. Products in HTS Chapter 44 (wood and articles of wood) are the primary candidates, though coverage is selective and not all wood products qualify.</p>

                    <h2 id="energy">Energy Products</h2>

                    <p>Energy products receive among the broadest exemptions under Section 122, reflecting the simple reality that <strong>taxing energy imports would raise costs for every sector of the economy</strong>. The United States, despite being a net energy exporter for certain fuels, still imports significant volumes of crude oil, refined petroleum products, natural gas, and specialized energy commodities. A 15% tariff on these imports would cascade through every supply chain that depends on fuel, power, and petrochemical feedstocks.</p>

                    <p>The Annex exempts <strong>crude oil, refined petroleum products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, heating oil), natural gas (both pipeline and LNG), uranium and nuclear fuel elements, and coal</strong> under certain classifications. The exemption also covers certain petrochemical feedstocks &mdash; the raw materials used to manufacture plastics, synthetic fibers, fertilizers, and pharmaceutical intermediates. These products fall primarily under HTS Chapter 27 (mineral fuels, oils, and products of their distillation).</p>

                    <p>The energy exemption is arguably the least controversial category in the Annex. Virtually no policy analyst, regardless of political orientation, advocates for taxing energy imports given the direct and immediate impact on consumer prices and industrial costs. The exemption ensures that the Section 122 tariff achieves its trade-deficit reduction goal without triggering an energy price shock that would undermine the broader economy.</p>

                    <h2 id="verify-exemption">How to Verify If Your Products Are Exempt</h2>

                    <p>Knowing that exemptions exist is not enough. You need to confirm whether your specific products qualify. Here is the five-step process every importer should follow:</p>

                                <p>The Section 122 exemptions are defined at the HTS subheading and statistical suffix level. A product classified at the 4-digit or 6-digit level may appear to be in an exempt category, but only specific 10-digit codes are listed in the Annex. Pull your entry documents and confirm the exact classification being used for your imports. If you are unsure of your product's correct HTS code, this is the time to get a definitive classification &mdash; not after CBP issues an assessment.</p>

                    <h2 id="3pl-mixed-tariff">How a 3PL Helps You Manage Mixed-Tariff Inventory</h2>

                    <p>For importers who bring in both exempt and non-exempt products, tariff management adds a layer of operational complexity that goes beyond customs paperwork. Your warehouse operations, inventory tracking, and fulfillment processes need to account for the different duty status of each product. This is where a capable 3PL partner becomes essential.</p>

                    <div class="article-feature-grid">
                        <div class="feature-item">
                            <h4>Inventory Segregation</h4>
                            <p>A 3PL can physically and systematically separate exempt and non-exempt goods within the warehouse. This segregation ensures accurate duty tracking, prevents commingling errors that could trigger CBP compliance issues, and gives you clear visibility into the landed cost of each product line. When audit time comes, you have clean inventory records showing exactly which goods entered under which tariff treatment.</p>

                            <p>Your 3PL coordinates directly with customs brokers to ensure that every shipment is classified correctly at the point of entry. For mixed shipments containing both exempt and non-exempt products, the 3PL ensures that entry documents properly break out the exemption claims line by line. This prevents overpayment on exempt goods and ensures full compliance on non-exempt goods &mdash; avoiding both wasted money and penalty exposure.</p>

                            <p>For non-exempt goods that are subject to the full 15% duty, a 3PL with access to a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) can defer duty payments until the goods enter domestic commerce. This is especially valuable during the 150-day uncertainty window &mdash; if the Section 122 tariff expires or is reduced, goods held in an FTZ would benefit from the lower rate at the time of entry. FTZ storage effectively gives you optionality on your tariff exposure.</p>

                            <h3>Are ALL agricultural products exempt from the 15% tariff?</h3>
                            <p>No. The exemption covers <strong>certain agricultural commodities</strong> &mdash; primarily fresh produce, raw grains, and unprocessed staple foods critical to the U.S. food supply. Processed foods, packaged consumer goods, and specialty agricultural products generally do not qualify. The exemptions are defined by specific HTS codes in the Section 122 Annex, and importers must verify their exact classification. For example, fresh bananas (HTS 0803) are likely exempt, while banana-flavored snack bars are not. Always check at the 10-digit HTS level.</p>

                            <p>Generally no. The pharmaceutical exemption is targeted at <strong>active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), finished pharmaceutical drugs, and FDA-regulated medical devices</strong>. Cosmetics, dietary supplements, and wellness products are classified under different HTS codes and do not fall within the exemption. The distinction is regulatory: if the FDA regulates your product as a drug or medical device, it is likely covered. If it is classified as a cosmetic or dietary supplement, it is not. Some products that straddle categories &mdash; such as medical-grade skincare or prescription-strength supplements &mdash; may require a classification ruling to determine eligibility.</p>

                            <p>Check your HTS code against the Section 122 Annex. Most <strong>integrated circuits, semiconductor wafers, bare chips, and chip manufacturing equipment</strong> are covered under the exemption, which aligns with CHIPS Act priorities. The exemption extends to packaging and testing equipment used in semiconductor fabrication. However, finished consumer electronics that contain semiconductors &mdash; smartphones, laptops, televisions &mdash; do <strong>not</strong> qualify. The exemption applies to the component, not the end product. Consult your customs broker for a definitive classification, especially for specialty or hybrid electronic components.</p>

                            <p>Yes. Exemption from the Section 122 15% global tariff <strong>does not override other existing tariff programs</strong>. Your products may still be subject to Section 301 tariffs (primarily on Chinese goods), Section 232 tariffs (on steel and aluminum), country-specific tariffs on Canada (35%) and Mexico (25%), antidumping and countervailing duties, and standard Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rates. Each tariff authority operates independently. A semiconductor wafer exempt from Section 122 may still face Section 301 duties if it originates from China.

                            <p>Incorrect exemption claims can result in <strong>significant penalties</strong>. CBP may assess the full 15% duty retroactively with interest from the original entry date, impose civil penalties for negligence or gross negligence (which can range from 2x to 4x the unpaid duty), and flag your importer account for enhanced scrutiny on all future entries. In cases of intentional misclassification, criminal fraud charges are possible. The best protection is thorough documentation: maintain your HTS classification basis, broker correspondence, CBP ruling letters, and product specifications in an organized compliance file for every exempt product you import.</p>

                    <h2 id="exemption-framework">Entendiendo el Marco de Exenciones de la Secci&oacute;n 122</h2>

                    <p>Cuando la administraci&oacute;n invoc&oacute; la Secci&oacute;n 122 de la Ley de Comercio de 1974 el 22 de febrero de 2026, la proclamaci&oacute;n no simplemente impuso un arancel general del 15% sobre todas las importaciones. Incluy&oacute; un <strong>Anexo detallado de c&oacute;digos HTS</strong> que est&aacute;n expl&iacute;citamente excluidos del nuevo arancel. Este Anexo es la lista de exenciones &mdash; y comprenderlo es cr&iacute;tico para cada importador que hace negocios en Estados Unidos.</p>

                    <p>M&aacute;s del <strong>90% de las exenciones de la Secci&oacute;n 122 replican las exclusiones</strong> que previamente exist&iacute;an bajo el programa arancelario rec&iacute;proco. Esto no es coincidencia. La administraci&oacute;n mantuvo la misma l&oacute;gica de pol&iacute;tica: los productos cr&iacute;ticos para la manufactura estadounidense, seguridad nacional, infraestructura de salud y suministro alimentario no deben ser gravados con aranceles de importaci&oacute;n adicionales que en &uacute;ltima instancia elevar&iacute;an los costos para las empresas y consumidores estadounidenses.</p>

                    <p>El marco de exenciones cubre siete categor&iacute;as principales: agricultura y productos alimenticios, farmac&eacute;uticos y dispositivos m&eacute;dicos, semiconductores y componentes electr&oacute;nicos, cobre y productos de cobre, minerales cr&iacute;ticos, madera y productos forestales, y productos energ&eacute;ticos. Dentro de cada categor&iacute;a, las exenciones se definen a nivel de <strong>c&oacute;digo HTS</strong> &mdash; lo que significa que no todos los productos dentro de una categor&iacute;a amplia califican autom&aacute;ticamente. Una manzana fresca y un pastel de manzana empaquetado pueden ser ambos "agricultura", pero solo uno probablemente est&aacute; exento.</p>

                            <strong>Advertencia Cr&iacute;tica:</strong> Estar en una "categor&iacute;a exenta" no significa autom&aacute;ticamente que su producto espec&iacute;fico califique. Las exenciones se definen por c&oacute;digos HTS precisos listados en el Anexo de la Secci&oacute;n 122. Debe verificar su clasificaci&oacute;n HTS exacta de 10 d&iacute;gitos contra el Anexo. Reclamar una exenci&oacute;n para un producto que no califica puede resultar en sanciones, evaluaciones retroactivas de aranceles y auditor&iacute;as de CBP.

                    <p>La justificaci&oacute;n detr&aacute;s de cada categor&iacute;a de exenci&oacute;n sigue un tema consistente: Estados Unidos depende de estas importaciones para funciones esenciales, y gravarlas causar&iacute;a m&aacute;s da&ntilde;o a la econom&iacute;a dom&eacute;stica de lo que los ingresos arancelarios compensar&iacute;an. Los farmac&eacute;uticos mantienen los hospitales abastecidos. Los semiconductores mantienen las f&aacute;bricas funcionando. Los productos energ&eacute;ticos mantienen las luces encendidas. Las exenciones no son favores &mdash; son necesidades econ&oacute;micas.</p>

                    <h2 id="agriculture">Agricultura y Productos Alimenticios</h2>

                    <p>Las exenciones agr&iacute;colas bajo la Secci&oacute;n 122 est&aacute;n dise&ntilde;adas para proteger la cadena de suministro alimentario de EE.UU. de choques de costos que en &uacute;ltima instancia se trasladar&iacute;an a los consumidores. Estados Unidos importa aproximadamente <strong>$200 mil millones en productos agr&iacute;colas anualmente</strong>, y muchas de estas importaciones llenan vac&iacute;os que la producci&oacute;n dom&eacute;stica no puede cubrir &mdash; frutas tropicales, productos fuera de temporada, granos especiales y materias primas que sirven como insumos para los fabricantes de alimentos estadounidenses.</p>

                    <p>Los productos exentos en esta categor&iacute;a se concentran en <strong>productos agr&iacute;colas crudos y m&iacute;nimamente procesados</strong>. Frutas y verduras frescas, granos y cereales sin procesar, animales vivos para cr&iacute;a, az&uacute;car crudo, granos de caf&eacute;, granos de cacao y ciertas semillas oleaginosas est&aacute;n entre los productos listados en el Anexo. Estos son los pilares del sistema alimentario estadounidense &mdash; productos que no pueden sustituirse f&aacute;cilmente con alternativas dom&eacute;sticas a corto plazo.</p>

                    <p>Sin embargo, la exenci&oacute;n no se extiende ampliamente a alimentos procesados, bienes de consumo empaquetados o productos agr&iacute;colas de valor agregado. Si su producto ha experimentado manufactura o procesamiento significativo &mdash; productos enlatados, comidas congeladas, snacks empaquetados, bebidas embotelladas &mdash; es poco probable que califique. La l&iacute;nea entre "materia prima" y "producto procesado" puede ser ambigua, por lo que los importadores del sector alimentario deben trabajar estrechamente con su agente aduanal para confirmar su clasificaci&oacute;n HTS espec&iacute;fica contra el Anexo. Los productos en los Cap&iacute;tulos 1 al 24 del HTS son los m&aacute;s propensos a contener exenciones, pero la cobertura es selectiva, no general.</p>

                    <h2 id="pharmaceuticals">Farmac&eacute;uticos y Dispositivos M&eacute;dicos</h2>

                    <p>Las exenciones farmac&eacute;uticas y de dispositivos m&eacute;dicos representan una de las exclusiones m&aacute;s significativas en el arancel de la Secci&oacute;n 122. Estados Unidos importa una porci&oacute;n sustancial de su cadena de suministro farmac&eacute;utica &mdash; <strong>m&aacute;s del 80% de los ingredientes farmac&eacute;uticos activos (APIs)</strong> usados en medicamentos fabricados en Estados Unidos provienen del extranjero, principalmente de India y China. Gravar estos insumos aumentar&iacute;a directamente el costo de medicamentos recetados, suministros hospitalarios y tratamientos m&eacute;dicos.</p>

                    <p>El Anexo exime una amplia gama de productos farmac&eacute;uticos: <strong>ingredientes farmac&eacute;uticos activos (APIs), medicamentos farmac&eacute;uticos terminados (tanto de marca como gen&eacute;ricos), biol&oacute;gicos, vacunas, reactivos de diagn&oacute;stico y dispositivos m&eacute;dicos regulados por la FDA</strong>. Esto incluye dispositivos m&eacute;dicos Clase I, II y III &mdash; todo desde instrumentos quir&uacute;rgicos y dispositivos implantables hasta equipos de imagenolog&iacute;a y m&aacute;quinas de diagn&oacute;stico. La exenci&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n cubre ciertos intermedios farmac&eacute;uticos y sustancias farmac&eacute;uticas a granel utilizadas en la manufactura dom&eacute;stica.</p>

                    <p>Lo que no est&aacute; cubierto: cosm&eacute;ticos, suplementos diet&eacute;ticos, productos de bienestar, productos veterinarios (con algunas excepciones) y productos de salud no regulados por la FDA. La distinci&oacute;n es la clasificaci&oacute;n regulatoria &mdash; si la FDA regula su producto como medicamento o dispositivo m&eacute;dico, probablemente est&aacute; exento. Si cae bajo clasificaciones de cosm&eacute;ticos, suplementos o productos de consumo, no lo est&aacute;. Los importadores deben consultar la clasificaci&oacute;n FDA de su producto junto con el c&oacute;digo HTS para determinar la elegibilidad. Los productos clasificados bajo los Cap&iacute;tulos 29 del HTS (qu&iacute;micos org&aacute;nicos, incluyendo APIs) y 30 (productos farmac&eacute;uticos) son los principales candidatos, junto con dispositivos m&eacute;dicos en el Cap&iacute;tulo 90.</p>

                    <h2 id="semiconductors">Semiconductores y Componentes Electr&oacute;nicos</h2>

                    <p>La exenci&oacute;n de semiconductores es una extensi&oacute;n directa de la estrategia del CHIPS and Science Act. Estados Unidos ha invertido m&aacute;s de <strong>$52 mil millones en manufactura dom&eacute;stica de semiconductores</strong> a trav&eacute;s del CHIPS Act, y gravar los componentes y equipos necesarios para construir y operar instalaciones de fabricaci&oacute;n de chips socavar&iacute;a esa inversi&oacute;n. La exenci&oacute;n asegura que el arancel no cree una barrera de costos para la misma pol&iacute;tica industrial que el gobierno est&aacute; persiguiendo.</p>

                    <p>Los productos exentos incluyen <strong>obleas de semiconductores (tanto procesadas como sin procesar), circuitos integrados, microprocesadores, chips de memoria, chips l&oacute;gicos, semiconductores de potencia, equipos de fabricaci&oacute;n de semiconductores, herramientas de fotolitograf&iacute;a, m&aacute;quinas de grabado y deposici&oacute;n, y equipos de empaquetado y prueba de chips</strong>. La cobertura se extiende a trav&eacute;s de la cadena de suministro de semiconductores &mdash; desde obleas de silicio crudo hasta la maquinaria especializada utilizada en la fabricaci&oacute;n. Esto es cr&iacute;tico porque la mayor&iacute;a de los equipos avanzados de fabricaci&oacute;n de semiconductores provienen de Pa&iacute;ses Bajos (ASML), Jap&oacute;n (Tokyo Electron) y Estados Unidos mismo, y la cadena de suministro es profundamente global.</p>

                    <p>La exenci&oacute;n <strong>no</strong> se extiende a electr&oacute;nica de consumo terminada que contiene semiconductores. Una oblea de semiconductor est&aacute; exenta; una laptop o smartphone terminado no. La distinci&oacute;n es entre el componente y el producto final. Los importadores de componentes electr&oacute;nicos deben verificar sus productos al nivel HTS de 10 d&iacute;gitos, ya que la cobertura es espec&iacute;fica. Los productos clasificados bajo las partidas HTS 8541 (dispositivos semiconductores) y 8542 (circuitos integrados electr&oacute;nicos) son las categor&iacute;as exentas principales, junto con c&oacute;digos espec&iacute;ficos de equipos de fabricaci&oacute;n en el Cap&iacute;tulo 84.</p>

                    <h2 id="copper">Cobre y Minerales Cr&iacute;ticos</h2>

                    <p>El cobre ocupa una posici&oacute;n &uacute;nica en la econom&iacute;a industrial de EE.UU. Es esencial para el <strong>cableado el&eacute;ctrico, construcci&oacute;n, electr&oacute;nica, manufactura de veh&iacute;culos el&eacute;ctricos, sistemas de energ&iacute;a renovable e infraestructura de telecomunicaciones</strong>. Estados Unidos es un importador neto de cobre, y la capacidad dom&eacute;stica de miner&iacute;a y refinaci&oacute;n no puede satisfacer la demanda actual &mdash; y mucho menos la demanda creciente impulsada por la electrificaci&oacute;n y la construcci&oacute;n de energ&iacute;a verde.</p>

                    <p>El Anexo de la Secci&oacute;n 122 exime <strong>c&aacute;todos de cobre refinado, aleaciones de cobre (incluyendo lat&oacute;n y bronce), alambre y cable de cobre, tubos y tuber&iacute;as de cobre, l&aacute;mina de cobre y chatarra de cobre</strong>. La inclusi&oacute;n de chatarra de cobre es notable &mdash; EE.UU. es tanto importador como exportador de chatarra de cobre, y la cadena de suministro de reciclaje depende del movimiento libre de aranceles de este material. Los productos clasificados bajo el Cap&iacute;tulo 74 del HTS (cobre y art&iacute;culos de cobre) forman el n&uacute;cleo de esta exenci&oacute;n.</p>

                    <p>La exenci&oacute;n de minerales cr&iacute;ticos se extiende m&aacute;s all&aacute; del cobre para incluir <strong>elementos de tierras raras, litio, cobalto, n&iacute;quel, grafito, manganeso, vanadio y otros minerales</strong> considerados esenciales para la seguridad nacional y la cadena de suministro de veh&iacute;culos el&eacute;ctricos. Estados Unidos actualmente importa m&aacute;s del 80% de sus necesidades de minerales cr&iacute;ticos, principalmente de China, Australia, Chile y la Rep&uacute;blica Democr&aacute;tica del Congo. La lista de exenciones para minerales cr&iacute;ticos se alinea estrechamente con la estrategia de minerales cr&iacute;ticos del Departamento de Energ&iacute;a y puede expandirse a medida que se a&ntilde;adan minerales adicionales a la lista federal de minerales cr&iacute;ticos. Los productos en los Cap&iacute;tulos 26 del HTS (minerales), 28 (qu&iacute;micos inorg&aacute;nicos) y 81 (otros metales base) son las categor&iacute;as principales a verificar.</p>

                    <h2 id="lumber">Madera y Productos Forestales</h2>

                    <p>La exenci&oacute;n de madera y productos forestales est&aacute; impulsada por la pol&iacute;tica de vivienda. Estados Unidos enfrenta un <strong>d&eacute;ficit de vivienda estimado en 4 a 7 millones de unidades</strong>, y la madera es el insumo material m&aacute;s grande en la construcci&oacute;n residencial. Imponer un arancel del 15% sobre la madera importada aumentar&iacute;a directamente el costo de la construcci&oacute;n de viviendas nuevas en un momento en que la asequibilidad ya est&aacute; en niveles de crisis.</p>

                    <p>Los productos exentos incluyen <strong>madera blanda (la madera estructural principal utilizada en la construcci&oacute;n de viviendas), madera contrachapada, tableros de virutas orientadas (OSB), ciertos productos de madera dura, madera sin procesar, astillas de madera y madera para pulpa</strong>. Estos son los materiales b&aacute;sicos que fluyen hacia la cadena de suministro de construcci&oacute;n y renovaci&oacute;n de viviendas. El Anexo apunta a los productos que constructores y contratistas compran en volumen &mdash; la madera para marcos, revestimiento y paneles estructurales que forman el esqueleto de los hogares estadounidenses.</p>

                    <p>Un matiz importante: <strong>la madera canadiense est&aacute; exenta del arancel de la Secci&oacute;n 122, pero sigue sujeta a aranceles separados sobre madera blanda</strong> que han estado vigentes durante a&ntilde;os bajo &oacute;rdenes de antidumping y derechos compensatorios. La exenci&oacute;n de la Secci&oacute;n 122 no anula esos aranceles de remedios comerciales existentes. Los importadores de madera canadiense no deben asumir que la exenci&oacute;n elimina todos los costos arancelarios &mdash; solo la nueva capa del 15% de la Secci&oacute;n 122. Los productos en el Cap&iacute;tulo 44 del HTS (madera y art&iacute;culos de madera) son los principales candidatos, aunque la cobertura es selectiva y no todos los productos de madera califican.</p>

                    <h2 id="energy">Productos Energ&eacute;ticos</h2>

                    <p>Los productos energ&eacute;ticos reciben algunas de las exenciones m&aacute;s amplias bajo la Secci&oacute;n 122, reflejando la simple realidad de que <strong>gravar las importaciones de energ&iacute;a elevar&iacute;a los costos para todos los sectores de la econom&iacute;a</strong>. Estados Unidos, a pesar de ser un exportador neto de energ&iacute;a para ciertos combustibles, a&uacute;n importa vol&uacute;menes significativos de petr&oacute;leo crudo, productos refinados del petr&oacute;leo, gas natural y productos energ&eacute;ticos especializados. Un arancel del 15% sobre estas importaciones se propagar&iacute;a a trav&eacute;s de cada cadena de suministro que depende de combustible, energ&iacute;a y materias primas petroqu&iacute;micas.</p>

                    <p>El Anexo exime <strong>petr&oacute;leo crudo, productos refinados del petr&oacute;leo (gasolina, di&eacute;sel, combustible para aviones, aceite de calefacci&oacute;n), gas natural (tanto por gasoducto como GNL), uranio y elementos de combustible nuclear, y carb&oacute;n</strong> bajo ciertas clasificaciones. La exenci&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n cubre ciertas materias primas petroqu&iacute;micas &mdash; las materias primas utilizadas para fabricar pl&aacute;sticos, fibras sint&eacute;ticas, fertilizantes e intermedios farmac&eacute;uticos. Estos productos caen principalmente bajo el Cap&iacute;tulo 27 del HTS (combustibles minerales, aceites y productos de su destilaci&oacute;n).</p>

                    <p>La exenci&oacute;n energ&eacute;tica es posiblemente la categor&iacute;a menos controvertida del Anexo. Pr&aacute;cticamente ning&uacute;n analista de pol&iacute;tica, independientemente de su orientaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica, aboga por gravar las importaciones de energ&iacute;a dado el impacto directo e inmediato en los precios al consumidor y los costos industriales. La exenci&oacute;n asegura que el arancel de la Secci&oacute;n 122 logre su objetivo de reducci&oacute;n del d&eacute;ficit comercial sin provocar un shock de precios energ&eacute;ticos que socavar&iacute;a la econom&iacute;a en general.</p>

                    <h2 id="verify-exemption">C&oacute;mo Verificar Si Sus Productos Est&aacute;n Exentos</h2>

                    <p>Saber que existen exenciones no es suficiente. Necesita confirmar si sus productos espec&iacute;ficos califican. Aqu&iacute; est&aacute; el proceso de cinco pasos que todo importador debe seguir:</p>

                    <p>Para importadores que traen tanto productos exentos como no exentos, la gesti&oacute;n arancelaria a&ntilde;ade una capa de complejidad operativa que va m&aacute;s all&aacute; del papeleo aduanero. Sus operaciones de almac&eacute;n, seguimiento de inventario y procesos de cumplimiento necesitan considerar el diferente estatus arancelario de cada producto. Aqu&iacute; es donde un socio 3PL capaz se vuelve esencial.</p>

                            <p>Un 3PL puede separar f&iacute;sica y sistem&aacute;ticamente los bienes exentos y no exentos dentro del almac&eacute;n. Esta segregaci&oacute;n asegura un seguimiento preciso de aranceles, previene errores de mezcla que podr&iacute;an provocar problemas de cumplimiento con CBP, y le da visibilidad clara del costo de internaci&oacute;n de cada l&iacute;nea de producto.
